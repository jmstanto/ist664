incredible lineup of presentations, offered attendees some 
changes to the regular program of events.  The most significant 
of these was the trial run of student poster presentations.  
We started small, with just six students participating, and 
found that we had not only offered students the valuable 
opportunity to be involved at the conference level, but we had 
also provided veteran librarians with a direct view of what 
is going on in library schools around the country.  And with 
instruction in a constant state of forward movement, it was 
interesting to see how the progression was affecting change 
at the very beginning of the career path.  Connecting students 
with instruction librarians, and vice versa, proved to be a 
perfect match - one that we plan to keep as part of future 
conferences.   
 The hard work of the 2006 Planning Committee 
produced and incredibly informative, memorable, and exciting 
conference with keynote addresses by Scott Walter and Joan 
Lippincott. Opening remarks were given by Trudi Bellardo Hahn, who was also responsible for taking the initiative for 
bringing LOEX to Maryland.  
 I would like to extend a sincere thank you to Maggie 
Cunningham, chair of the 2006 Planning Committee, and 
Diane Harvey, co-chair, for their unending dedication to this 
conference.  Their team included Sue Baughman, Bob Garber, 
Jenny Hatleberg, Travis Johnson, Judy Markowitz, Barbara 
Nail-Chiwetalu, Joan Stahl, and Cindy Todd.  Administrative 
support was provided by Ashley Rogers and Megen Cox, 
graduate students in the User Education Services department.
 Again, we are so fortunate to be able to meet annually 
to share and discuss the latest ideas and research in library 
instruction.   Please enjoy perusing this fine set of proceedings 
from the 34th annual LOEX Conference: Moving Targets: 
Understanding Our Changing Landscapes.

 Problem-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogy that 
requires critical thinking, problem solving, and information 
literacy skills. In short, PBL is a perfect partner for library 
instruction. But what is the best way to coordinate your efforts 
with those of faculty so that students get the maximum learning 
benefit? Look for the commonalities – the basic dance steps 
that everyone can follow.
 Both PBL and information literacy share in common 
the five objectives from the ACRL Information Literacy 
Standards. These objectives and their specific outcomes point 
to what students should be able to do: determine the kind and 
quantity of information needed (what do you know v. what 
you’d like to find out), access the necessary information, 
evaluate information, use information to accomplish a purpose 
(solve a real world problem), and access and use information 
ethically and legally.
 PBL has the potential to increase student retention 
of subject knowledge and information literacy skills through 
application by working with faculty on problem creation, 
determining roles (who leads, who follows), and providing the 
right level of research support for students.
pr oB LeM-Ba s e d Le a r n i n g  a n d in f o r MaTi o n LiTe r a C Y
 Finkle and Torp (1995) stated that problem-based 
learning is a “development and instructional approach built 
around an ill-structured problem which is messy and complex in 
nature; requires inquiry, information-gathering, and reflection; 
is changing and tentative; and has no simple, fixed, formulaic, 
“right” solution.”
 Instead of the usual term paper assignment, students work in 
small groups on a real-world problem. This approach helps 
students retain and apply course content as well as teaches 
them how to approach and produce solutions to any problem 
they may face in their academic or personal lives.
A good PBL problem:
• Is engaging and oriented to the real-world
• Is not merely a “task” but a journey
• Generates multiple hypotheses
• Requires in-depth research
• Requires team effort
• Is consistent with desired learning outcomes
• Builds upon previous knowledge/experiences
• Promotes development of higher order cognitive skills
These PBL problem characteristics clearly articulate the need for 
information literacy.
 The ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards 
for Higher Education  define information literacy as a set of abilities 
requiring individuals to “recognize when information is needed and 
have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed 
information.” Information literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning 
and is common to all disciplines and learning environments, and to 
all levels of education. Together, PBL and information literacy share 
the bond of learning outcomes. What should we be able to do to be 
considered information literate or knowledgeable about a subject? 
At what level? How can we be more honest with students about our 
expectations? How can we be more honest with students about their 
skill level? What about retention of knowledge and skill level?

-CeLiTa dearMo n d-  4    L o e x-2006   The ACRL Information Literacy objectives (and their measurable 
outcomes) are the cornerstone for successful PBL practice:
• Determine the kind and quantity of information needed;
• Access the necessary information effectively and   
 efficiently;
• Evaluate information and its sources critically;
• Use information successfully to accomplish a specific   
 purpose;
• Access and use information ethically and legally.
 
 V arious outcomes from these objectives can be found in 
instructor syllabi and assignments and also in curriculum planning for 
library instruction sessions. The wording in the instructor syllabus may 
be different from that which the librarian uses, but these objectives are 
the shared dance steps between information literacy and PBL.
Th e da nCe
 Who leads, who follows? The faculty member and the 
librarian trade off and share in both roles. The faculty member usually 
makes first contact, with their PBL problem already in hand. Hopefully, 
faculty will prefer to discuss the PBL problem with the librarian before 
finalizing the problem to see what possible resources are available for 
student research. Problem discussion between faculty member and 
librarian gives the librarian the opportunity to incorporate stated and 
measurable information literacy objectives into the overall project. 
A date and time for the library instruction session is set. The faculty 
member introduces the problem to their students and forms small 
groups to discuss the problem and the overall PBL process.
 A week or two before the library session, the librarian and 
faculty member should discuss the PBL problem again, exchanging 
concerns and initial research plans that students may have about the 
problem. If the scheduling is possible, it’s best if the librarian has an 
in-classroom visit to listen in on each group’s plans for research. The 
librarian should not interject during these listening sessions. The basis 
of PBL is comprised of students coming up with their own questions 
and creating a plan to answer those questions for themselves. Student 
groups identify specific learning issues that they need to research. 
What do they know or think they know about the problem? What do 
they need to find out in order to create a solution to the problem?
 During the library session, the librarian should play the role 
of moderator, opening the floor up for general discussion of the PBL 
problem. A very effective means of letting students take ownership of 
the session is for the librarian to take notes on an overhead or other 
medium as each group shares their research concerns or questions. 
Again, the librarian should not interject at this point. Listening and 
validating students’ research concerns is an important first step in 
the research phase of the PBL process. The students are your dance 
partners, too.Ask students to define their learning issues and articulate their action 
plan:
• What questions does the problem raise?
• What do you think you know in order to answer?
• What do you need to find out in order to resolve the   
 problem?
 
 It seems somewhat redundant to go through this process, 
particularly so if the librarian has visited the class prior to the library 
session. A librarian’s first instinct when faced with a new class to teach 
is to hunt and gather relevant sources and create the ultimate handout. 
Then the librarian wants to share the ultimate handout to the students at 
the beginning of the session. But students need to be able to articulate 
their information needs first before jumping into research. They need to 
make that connection between what they need versus what research tool 
will get them there. After the students articulate their research needs, 
the librarian can demonstrate how to create a flexible search strategy 
by highlighting key words provided by the students and placing them 
and their possible synonyms in an AND/OR grid. Give students some 
time to form more search strategies for their group learning issues, then 
turn them loose to search through books, articles, reference materials, 
whatever is appropriate for their questions. Provide a blank worksheet 
so that students can keep track of their search strategies and take notes 
on potential sources. Ask the students to find at least two relevant, 
promising sources and note any subject headings or key words that 
they might add to their search strategy.
 Since the race to beat the clock is always a factor with library 
sessions, one way to help expedite student access to resources and to 
extend library instruction past the scheduled time is to create online 
course research guides. Take that ultimate two-page paper handout 
and put it in a template on a web page. Focus on the overall process 
of research. Incorporate transferable concepts. Create links to the 
databases. Give sample searches for the catalog and the databases. 
Even more helpful are small screen captures of sample searches from 
online tools. This may sound like a lot of work, but the time you spend 
frontloading information into these online course research guides 
means that you have more time during the session to assist students 
individually or in their groups. Students might also be more likely to 
use an online guide than consult a paper handout. Once students land on 
the online guide, you can simply have them scroll to whatever research 
tool might be most useful for their particularly learning issue. The 
screen captures provide a timesaving solution to the “watch me demo 
this, then you do it” classroom technique. Students can easily look at a 
screen capture, click on the database link, and then fashion their search 
to “look like the picture.” The online research guides can be linked 
to the faculty member’s web site and/or WebCT space. Alternately, 
librarians can link to faculty web sites, research plan worksheets, and 
other helpful materials on the online guide such as how to evaluate and 
cite sources.
 As the students use the course research guide during the 
session, both the librarian and faculty member circulate among each 
group providing search tips, help with strategy and tool selection, and 
encouragement. Depending on how well the session goes and what 
reaction students have to the PBL task during the initial research phase, 
Lo e x-2006    5 -da nCi n g w iTh pr oB LeM-Ba s e d Le a r n i n g : Th e pe r f e C T pa rTn e r-a follow-up library session where groups can get more specialized 
assistance might be a good idea. Remember, the more contact and 
discussion you have with the faculty member during this crucial phase 
the better you can assist faculty with their learning outcomes and 
ultimately provide a good research experience for the students. Ask 
the faculty member to require student groups to turn in their research 
worksheets and strategies as part of the PBL project. Librarians and 
faculty can look these over together and provide suggestions to help 
students achieve stated information literacy outcomes.
 
 One additional suggestion about the online research guides 
is to use a stat counter of some kind to keep track of access to the 
page. Some stat counters will include not only page loads and unique 
visitors, but also pathways showing how the users got there, through a 
web link or search. If students are using a search engine such as 
Google to find information, and they happen upon the online 
research guide and click on it, stat counters can let you know 
what key words the students typed in to get there. Based on this 
information, you can add helpful tips at the top of the guide 
or update information to highlight particular resources, again 
extending instruction past the library session. At the end of 
the semester, you can send faculty a report on the usage of the 
research guide.

sh oTs
 While PBL is a proven pedagogy for better retention 
of knowledge and application during semester long classes, 
you can also choose to use basic PBL principles in your one-
shot classes. Instead of starting class with a handout overview, 
put that handout online, let go, and engage students in topic 
discussion from the beginning. Use what you know about their 
assignment to get discussion rolling or select a sample topic 
for the overall subject at hand. Run the session using the two 
most important research questions: What do you know? What 
do you want to find out? Become the moderator and take notes 
on an overhead or other medium to validate their responses and 
provide visual stimulation. Help them create an initial search 
strategy with the AND/OR grid and then turn the students 
loose on the course research guide or library web site. Provide 
a blank research worksheet so that students can create their 
own breadcrumb trail of key words and search tools. Don’t let 
students search aimlessly. Require them to find at least two 
relevant sources for their own topic or for the sample topic. 
Circulate and encourage each student. In using these basic PBL 
techniques, you are allowing the library session to be more 
useful to the students. If you give students the flexibility to 
form their own path, the opportunity to share what they know, 
they will take away from the session what they really need. 
Not what we as librarians think they need. Plus, PBL takes 
the pressure off of the librarian to “perform” and creates 
a classroom dynamic that is a whole lot more interesting, 
engaging, and just plain fun.sa n anTo n i o  CoL Le g e faC U L T Y  o n da nCi n g w iTh

Dr. Thomas Clarkin, History:
 “Those students who availed themselves of the 
materials available in the library had greater success with the 
PBL activities in that they located useful information regarding 
their topic.   Students who ignored the instruction tended to 
have brief bibliographies that relied on Google searches to 
obtain information.”
 “I think that many students would not have fared well 
without guidance from the library.”
Carla Mendiola, History:
 “Breaking down the research process during class 
and then providing the research workshops was very helpful. 
It helped students better understand the research process and 
how to conduct research in the library.”
 “Knowing what sources are available to students helps 
me better shape my PBL expectations. It also gives me more 
ideas on materials to show them or incorporate into my classes. 
The library workshops, online guide, and class lectures/
activities help reinforce the PBL research message from two 
different sources, i.e., library and classroom.”
Dr. Jonathan Lee, History:
 “What I learned is that I have never really addressed the 
issue of student’s learning how to find good information. I must 
work on that.”
 “I was worried about their analytical abilities.   I should 
have realized that they need guidance on research abilities.”
Dr. Carol Keller, History:
 “Students are far more comfortable using major search 
engines and Wikipedia for quick reference information. But if 
we are to make them life-long learners in a substantive way, 
we need to challenge our students to routinely access scholarly 
materials as their current academic work demands.”
 “I want to stress how crucial the visual guide has been to 
student success, not only for visual learners but all learners .”
 “The key is to tailor each library workshop to course and 
assignment specific tasks.  While this means more work for both 
librarian and faculty member, the dividend of student success is worth 
the effort.”

University in Canada, is used to train medical professionals and 
is succinctly described on the McMaster website as “any learning 
environment where the problem drives the learning.” PBL is ideal for 
library instruction because it creates an active learning, team-based, 
assignment-related instruction experience that takes advantage of 
what students already know, and builds on that knowledge. The main 
components of PBL are:
• The Problem
• Students work in groups to define and analyze the   
 Problem
• Groups generate ideas: what they know, what they need   
 to know
• Groups develop a strategy to collect information in order   
 to solve the Problem
• Groups analyze information and generate solution(s)
 Though not training future doctors at Roger Williams 
University, we are using the principles of PBL in our Writing for 
the Professions and Introduction to Speech classes with very good 
results. In what sometimes appears to be a frantic relay between the 
instruction classroom and the library’s public-use computers, students 
engage in a learning experience that provides a hands-on introduction 
to the resources they will need for their research assignment. Working 
together, students and librarians explore a new territory where the 
learning experience is more about problem-solving and less about 
demonstrating resources.
ad v a n Ta g e s , Ch aL Le n g e s  a n d ea rL Y ef f o r Ts
 PBL and information literacy share the same intellectual 
terrain and rely heavily on critical thinking. The advantages of 
using PBL for library instruction are improved student engagement, active learning and peer support, with defined objectives and 
outcomes. Time constraints, which are always an issue in a one-
shot session, can be dealt with by creating a fixed agenda for the 
class. The librarian takes the role of collaborator in problem-
solving with demonstrating kept to a minimum. The tone of the 
class is active and it is important students know that passivity is 
not an option. Expectations on the part of the librarian set the mood 
for the session, and the librarian expects the groups  to solve the 
problem by the end of the class. PBL requires a different attitude 
on the part of the instructor and, therefore, this approach is not 
effective for all classes and may not suit the temperament of all 
teaching librarians.
 Our first attempt at PBL was a thoughtful and creative 
response to this scenario: I’d like to bring my students in for a library 
orientation. They need to know how to find a book, use the library 
databases, find articles, cite same, learn about plagiarism and do you 
think you can cover that in about 20 minutes ? Frustration with this 
kind of request, one most teaching librarians are faced with, led to the 
creation of our first learning problem and activity. The result was “The 
Senator Brittany Aguillera” problem below. A visit with a friend, who 
is the Chief Counsel to a US Senator, coincided with an upcoming 
Speech class. I thought about my friend’s job and his responsibilities 
and how I could use that to drive the instruction session. The scene 
was easy to set and derived from a real situation and a current issue. 
Focusing on the Children’s Internet Protection Act provided the basis 
for a very lively discussion at the end of the class.
Problem : You are the senior advisor to 
Senator Brittany Aguillera from New York 
City. In one hour , she needs to give a two 
minute presentation  on the Children’s  
Internet Protection Act  (CIPA)  to her 
constituents, but she doesn’t know if she’s 
in favor of it or against it. Your job is to find 
reliable, authoritative information from at 
least five different sources . The Senator ef f e C Ti v e MeTh o d s  f o r inCo r p o r a Ti n g pr oB LeM-Ba s e d

 Most of the students were in their first and second-year 
with little library experience or instruction. I focused on Deb 
Gilchrist’s (Dean, Library/Media Services, Pierce College, and 
ACRL Immersion faculty) mantra:
• What do you want the students to be able to do?   
 (Outcome)
• What does the student need to know? 
 (Curriculum)
• What’s the learning activity? 
 (Pedagogy)
• How will the student demonstrate the learning?   
 (Assessment)
• How will I know the student has done this well?   
 (Criteria)
 For this assignment, the objective was simple: to have 
students use multiple library resources in order to develop an 
opinion/speech/presentation on a specific topic. The curriculum 
was a brief introduction to several library resources: the library 
catalog, two databases, a government web site and an advocacy 
web site. The learning activity had students work in teams of two 
or three, dividing teams into those in favor of the Act and those 
against it. The process was outlined in a worksheet (see Appendix) 
provided by the librarian. The assessment came in the form of a 
debriefing with each group providing evidence in support of their 
position either for or against the legislation. The exercise addressed 
ACRL Standards 2 and 3. The problem was good, the pedagogy 
sound, but the worksheet was too directed: I told the students 
where to look, which keywords to use, what to look for in the 
articles, directed them to specific sites. It was all too programmed. 
I hadn’t achieved my goal of having the students work together to 
solve the problem with less direction and more engagement.

Th e pe d a g o g Y
 Improving this model of instruction for the Writing for 
the Professions classes was made easier when Prof. Mel Topf 
developed a case-based problem for one of his writing assignments. 
Combining the basic principles of PBL with the Information 
Literacy Standards, the following approach was taken to develop 
the pedagogy.
• Define what the students need to know how to do in   
 order to complete their assignment. What are the   
 objectives for the instruction session?
• Identify the expected outcomes:
       -    At the end of the session, students will be able to…  
    ..(again, be realistic)
  o Locate and navigate the library’s website;
 o Understand the purpose of using the library   
  resources:
  o Cost-effective: their tuition dollars at  
   work;
  o Efficient and accessible;
  o It’s what their instructors like (want).
 o Know the contact information  for a librarian;
 o Use several library databases to locate articles  
  on a topic;
 o Evaluate the quality of a resource based on   
  specific criteria.
•  Be realistic: what can we teach in 85 minutes?
•  Keep the ACRL Standards in mind: Locating,   
 identifying, evaluating, using. Which standards are   
 most appropriate for the class, the assignment and the  
 amount of time you have?
•  Decide which databases will be used. I usually specify  
 three: Academic Search Premier, Lexis-Nexis,   
 and ABI Inform.
•  Develop the activity, breaking it down into specific time  
 requirements and keeping to the schedule, i.e.:
o 10 minutes  to review, define and analyze the 
problem or case problem (ACRL Standard 1).
o 10 minutes  to demonstrate sources/databases, 
etc. Resist the urge to over-explain; it provides 
more opportunity to engage with students as 
they are doing the assignment. This is why it 
is important to limit the number of resources 
students will use (Standard 2).
o 30 minutes  to find the information.
o 10 minutes  for team consultation (Standard 4).
o 10 minutes  for debriefing (evaluating, Standard 
3).
•   Suggest work flow, i.e., each student uses one of the   
       resources to find information that will be shared amongst  
 them. This is very time-efficient. If there are four 
   students on a team, they will leave with four sources.
•   Provide handouts with criteria for evaluating sources.
oLd in sTrU C T i o n Mo d e L v. pBL
Old model:
• Class met three times over three weeks.
• Instruction sessions were general, not always specific to  
 an assignment.
• Covered catalog, research process, databases, ILL,   
              popular vs. scholarly journals, web evaluation, all out of   
              context. Boring and irrelevant from the students’ 
              perspective.
• Worksheets provided for each session covered too much         
 material. Students dutifully filled out the worksheets, 
              but were not fully engaged in the learning activity.
Lo e x-2006    9 -ef f e C Ti v e MeTh o d s  f o r inCo r p o r a Ti n g pr oB LeM-Ba s e d Le a r n i n g ...-New model:
• A 10-minute class visit introduces the librarian, and   
 the upcoming instruction session, with another brief   
 feedback session after completion of the assignment.
• Focus on solving problem, not demonstrating resources.
• Students are in charge of their own learning.
• The worksheet, when completed, provides most of the  
 research required for the assignment.
• We don’t try to cover everything. The objective is that     
 they know who we are and that the librarians are 
 advocates for their success. They do and will  return.   
              Our statistics confirm that individual research 
              consultations have increased.
• Capitalizes on students’ competencies and peer support:
• We introduce the resources with brief explanations. We    
 ask them to take notes and tell them why.
• We require a group report and give them specific
               questions they will be asked to answer, i.e.,
o What did they find?
o What source provided the best    
information?
o Did what they find provide evidence
        in support of their position?
o Did they encounter any surprises,      
problems, etc.?
Ch a n g e s
 Students are more enthusiastic about the process of 
learning to use the resources. The group environment provides 
the stimulus for involvement. The session is relevant to their 
assignment requiring teamwork and collaboration to reach 
a goal in a specified period of time. Worksheets are shorter 
and provide fewer directions. They leave with what they 
need in order to do the assignment. In the debriefing, the 
students provide the “solution” to the “problem,” i.e., they 
collaboratively reach a recommendation. This is the most 
exciting part of the exercise.as s e s s Me nT a n d fe e d BaC K
 After the session, students are required to send the 
librarian their list of references electronically by a specific 
date. The lists are graded and returned with comments. The 
grade becomes part of their overall grade for the assignment. 
The “Reference” sheet is expected to be in APA format, with 
a variety of at least five resources that provide evidence in 
support of their position. Their papers are returned during 
the feedback session by the librarian who provides a general 
overview of the class’ work and specific examples of papers 
that have been well done. Anecdotally, Prof. Topf has seen a 
significant increase in the quality of the resources used and we 
are currently collaborating to revise the model. Students are 
asking for more instruction, more exploration of the available 
databases, and more time spent on citation format and more 
consultation with the librarians. More is a good thing!

teams of two or three, dividing teams into those in favor of the Act and those against. Exercise addresses ACRL Standards 2 and 3.
Explain: abstract; word search in catalog; why they can’t use an article from American Libraries or Library Journal for #3. Briefly demo 
ASP and Lexis-Nexis. Assignment will be collected. Divide class into teams of two or three.
You are the senior advisor to Senator Brittany Aguillera from New York City. In one hour , she needs to give a two minute presentation  
on the Children’s Internet Protection Act  (CIPA)  to her constituents, but she doesn’t know if she’s in favor of it or against it. Your job 
is to find reliable, authoritative information from at least five different sources . The Senator is up for re-election and your job depends 
upon your getting accurate information fast.
Working in teams, use the following resources to gather information to make your case:
1. Read the attached abstract of an article on the subject to help you understand the Act and the issues.
2. Using the HELIN catalog from the RWU Library Homepage ( www.library.rwu.ed u), conduct a word search  for material on children 
and the internet. Fill in the bibliographic information on the material below (title, author, date published, publisher). Also note the 
location of the material (RWU, CCE, PC, etc.) and whether it is available (A) or not available (NA).
3. From the RWU Library Database Page ( http://library.rwu.edu/articles/articles.htm l), click on Academic Search Premier under 
Frequently Used Databases. Locate an article about CIPA.  THE ARTICLE MUST NOT  BE FROM AMERICAN LIBRARIES OR 
LIBRARY JOURNAL . Write the complete bibliographic information below AND  a sentence stating what the article is about.
4. From the RWU Library Database Page ( http://library.rwu.edu/articles/articles.htm l), click on Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe under 
Frequently Used Databases. Click on “Guided News Search.”
Using the Steps provided, conduct a search (using pull-down menus) in U.S. News, Northeast Regional Sources for the “Children’s 
Internet Protection Act” for the last six months in the New York Times . Locate an article and read it. From what you’ve read, are 
you in favor of the act or against it? Why? Write the article citation (New York Times, author, if provided, date, page and column #) and 
answers below.
5. Visit the following advocacy web site: The American Library Association, http://www.ala.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Our_
Association/Offices/ALA_Washington/Issues2/Civil_Liberties,_Intellectual_Freedom,_Privacy/CIPA1/CIPA.ht m
Does this site advocate for or against  CIPA? How do you know? 
6. Now visit the following government site: U. S. Dept. of Justice, FBI publication, “A Parent’s Guide to Internet Safety.” What kind 
of information is included on this site? How does the information provided help you to decide for or against the Children’s Internet 
Protection Act?
7. Using the information you have found, prepare a very short paragraph, three or four sentences, for Senator Aguillera to deliver to her 
constituents on whether or not she is in favor of or opposed to CIPA.

 This presentation investigates the appeal of digital gaming among 
students and what they learn while playing these games. While creating 
digital games for library instruction may not be realistic, librarians can 
adapt their instruction to meet the needs of digital natives—whose 
use of technology is fluidly apart of their lives—by understanding the 
educational benefits and alluring aspects of digital games.
Ch a r a C Te r i s TiCs o f gaMe r s
 Anyone could be a gamer. According to the Entertainment 
Software Association, 50% of all Americans play video games and 
the average age of these gamers is 30.19% of gamers are 50 years or 
older. Both male and female gamers play over seven hours a week 
with women over 18 a larger percentage of gamers than boys between 
6 and 17. Of those playing computer and video games, 55% are male 
and 43% are female. Gamers also participate in numerous other 
activities. For example, 93% of gamers report that they regularly read 
books or newspapers.
Learning Styles of Gamers
 How do gamers think and learn? With 70% of college students 
being game players (Jones, 2003), examining Millennial characteristics 
provides a starting point for librarians. Kipnis and Childs (2004) 
provide a list of Millennial characteristics including:
• Do not like being passive recipients of information
• Must be engaged to retain information
• Want a variety of learning experiences
• Are used to being entertained (p. 90) The learning style of gamers reflects these traits. Beck and Wade 
(2004b) depict this learning style as one that:
• Aggressively ignores any hint of formal instruction
• Leans heavily on trial and error
• Includes learning from peers but virtually none from              
       authority figures
• Information is consumed in very small bits exactly when 
       desired, which is usually just before the skill is needed 
       (p. 159)
 
 Beck and Wade (2004a) describe three aspects of the gamer 
mindset that apply to library instruction: risk taking, data immersion, 
and trial and error. Because of the ability to start games over if a 
mistake is made, they have learned “that all risks are survivable” (p. 
50). Failure is okay because you can start over and succeed the next 
time. This survivable risk taking contributes to completely immersing 
the player in a world of data, visuals, and strategy. Gamers enjoy the 
sensation of multitasking while processing data (2004b). In or out of 
the game, gamers use trial and error as a strategy to discover what 
works and what does not. As a result, they do not consult user manuals 
or handouts (2004a).
MoTi v aTi o n a n d en g a g e Me nT
 Superficially viewing digital games, one may believe the eye-
catching visuals and often salacious  content lure students to this 
medium.  Surprisingly a video game’s technological or sensational 
features do not explicitly motivate players. Creating tasks that are 
relatively easy to internalize paired with a high-speed tempo are key 
in motivating players (Prensky, 2001a).
 Furthermore, digital games motivate players to learn new skills 
and tasks because the medium aims to make the activity fun and 
entertaining.  When people participate in playful activities they are 
more likely to enjoy the learning process resulting in more time, effort, 
and concentration put into an activity (Prensky, 2001a). If individuals fi n d i n g  YoUr in n e r  gaMe r: ad a p Ti n g in sTrU C T i o n

greater educational collaboration with their peers (keynote address, 
November 3, 2005).
Ch a r a C Te r i s TiCs o f en g r o s s i n g  di g iTaL gaMe s
 The attraction of digital games lies not in one key feature, 
but in the balancing of multiple elements.  Specific attributes of 
excellent games are hard to describe since the elements are all 
interrelated and no one element can dominate without destroying 
a game’s attraction.  However certain attributes—rules/goals, 
control, fantasy—play an important role in player engagement.
Rules and Goals
 Rules and goals are essential to games, whether physical or 
virtual, entertaining or educational.  While individually distinct 
concepts, rules provide boundaries and help clarify the goals of 
a game.  Rules limit the actions of a player by forcing them to 
choose from a specified number of options, but with access to a 
wide array of tools and/or capabilities to move forward.  Clear 
goals motivate players and increase game performance through 
immediate feedback on whether the goal or task was achieved 
(Prensky, 2001a; Garris, Ahlers, and Driskell, 2002).
Control
 Just as students enjoy greater control and decision-making in 
the classroom, the same is true with gamers.  Digital games offer 
players control in various ways, from creating character identities 
to directing the game.  With players in control, responsibility shifts 
from the content creator to the gamer.  As with students when they 
lead the classroom, gamers have greater responsibility to learn and 
use the knowledge obtained when they are in control of a game 
(Garris et al., 2002).
Fantasy
 With fantasy, players become detached from reality and their 
own identity, freeing them to become more creative and daring.  
While it may appear gamers are trying to escape the problems of 
reality, fantasy can have unforeseen educational benefits.  Since 
games offer activities outside reality, real life consequences are 
lessened (Garris et al., 2002).  The fantasy element of digital 
games can contribute to learning new techniques by letting players 
test their hypotheses. Rules and norms can be tested or broken, 
even new rules can be created for a player to test the consequences 
of their actions (Squire et al., 2003).
edU CaTi o n a L Be n e f i Ts o f di g iTaL gaMi n g
 
 Combining the motivating and engaging elements in digital 
games can lead to greater appreciation of the benefits and skills 
needed to succeed in this medium.   While some skills such as hand-eye coordination are obviously gained from playing these games, 
other lesser known skills are also achieved and can be adapted for 
instruction.
Communication & Interaction
 Interaction separates digital games from other technological 
media.  Tutorials, movies, and television require participants 
to passively watch; on the other hand, digital games go beyond 
viewing by demanding the participant make choices for the game 
to move forward.  While interacting with the computer program, 
the player is given immediate feedback through multiple stimuli 
such as text, graphics, and sound (Dickey, 2005).
 
 While many consider digital gaming to be a solitary activity 
with a player interacting only with the virtual world, gaming 
enhances interpersonal communication skills in many ways. Not 
only must gamers ask for guidance, but they need to succinctly 
describe their dilemma with specific gaming language—a similar 
situation faced by our students in becoming information literate 
(Foreman, 2005). Gamers and information literate students alike 
must recognize weaknesses in their strategies and seek appropriate 
help (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000).
re p e TiTi o n
 Much like information searching, where a user must continually 
revise their search strategy, players must also repeatedly refine their 
skills in order to create the most effective and efficient process to 
reach their goals.  As a result, digital games often require players to 
continually repeat and modify their gaming techniques.  Through 
repetition, gamers develop skills by trial and error.  They will 
continually develop their knowledge until the skill is adequate to 
perform the task.  Since players are driven by the desire to advance 
in the game, repeating and refining tasks are not boring in this 
context (Gee, 2003).
pa r a L LeL pr oCe s s i n g
 One of the greatest benefits of digital gaming that can 
be incorporated into library instruction is parallel processing.  
Gamers must be able to interpret multiple elements at one time.  
Unlike other groups, gamers embrace the deluge of unfiltered 
information from which they interpret and manipulate data 
(Prensky, 2005). Gamers and other individuals who grew 
up with digital technology have different thought processes.  
Contrary to a linear thinking process, in which the individuals 
focus their senses on one element at a time, those in the 
parallel processing mode jump around.  Integrating digital 
games and the internet into their lives has trained gamers to 
efficiently interpret multidimensional images and quickly 
adapt to unanticipated or unexpected situations (2001b).  
Taking advantage of gamers’ innate parallel processing skills, 
librarians can teach students to view multiple areas of a 
website or database simultaneously.

 Viewing digital games from an educational standpoint, game 
designers effectively use active, experiential learning principles. 
The experiential pedagogy emphasizes the cyclical nature of 
learning when an individual tries and retries ideas in the same way 
gamers construct their knowledge by actively participating in an 
environment (Garris et al., 2002; Kiili, 2005).
Integrating Narrative and the First Person Perspective into 
Instruction
 Most gaming environments require the player to be an active 
participant in a story’s narrative.  A game moves forward not 
because of the software program, but through the actions of a 
player. As a result, a gamer is an essential part of the story and 
must keep exploring in order for narrative progression (Dickey, 
2005).  The information seeking process complements the narrative 
style found in digital games, which is often non-linear with players 
deciding the structure of the activity.  The same practice occurs in 
the research process when an individual branches out to discover 
other sources, repeats processes by revising searches, and goes in 
various directions initially not planned.
 Positioning a student in the first person point of view allows 
them to be an active participant in the environment instead of only 
observing.  In lecture style settings, the student takes the third 
person point of view, where the information taught may seem 
abstract and theoretical.  Using the first person perspective, allows 
students hands-on experience linking complex, abstract ideas with 
everyday experiences.
Power Ups
 Many of the gaming attributes stated earlier are found in the 
concept of power ups. Power ups are abilities or tools giving the 
player an added advantage. A gamer may receive strength, speed, 
weapons, or a menagerie of magical powers; sometimes even 
restore health. Some power ups begin instantaneously while others 
can be stored for later use.  The educational benefit of power ups is 
the player must learn to use resources effectively especially when 
using stored power ups.  The gamer is forced to allocate resources 
and decide the crucial moment to use a power up.  The gamer 
not only assesses the resources available, but must also forecast 
the consequences for future actions (Squire et al., 2003; Salen and 
Zimmerman, 2006; Wikipedia, 2006 ).
 In a library instruction classroom, power ups can engage 
students and ease frustration with unexpected assistance.  Scattering 
power ups through an activity can raise students’ competitive 
spirits making the activity engaging especially if students have to 
vie for limited power ups.  A simple power up is to randomly give 
students access to librarian help when searching for information.Feedback and Reflection
 For the fullest learning impact, gaming techniques should be 
followed by reflection and feedback with a librarian to reinforce the 
learning objectives of an activity and clarify questions. In digital 
games, players must reflect on their actions because there will be 
subsequent effects later.  Popular video games engage the player in a 
four step process:
1.  The player must probe  the virtual world
2.  Based on reflection while probing and afterward,   
  the player must form a hypothesis  about what    
  something might mean in a usefully situated way
3.   The player re-probes  the world with that hypothesis   
  in mind, seeing what effect he or she gets
4.  The player treats this effect as feedback from the      
  world and accepts or rethinks  his or her original  
  hypothesis. (Gee, 2003, p. 90)
 Students need to be able to reflect upon their actions, similar to 
the four step gaming process above, in order to effectively internalize 
information retrieval skills and to become information literate.  If 
reflection is absent from this process, students may go through an 
information retrieval activity simply copying a librarian without 
understanding their actions.  However, actions combined with 
discussion and reflection helps solidify the learning process (Prensky, 
2001a).
Co nC L U s i o n
 The application of gaming techniques into the classroom is rather 
new.  This presentation revealed the practical application of these 
techniques through the presenters’ instruction experiences and study 
of current literature. Research shows students become increasingly 
engaged and motivated to learn when digital gaming is incorporated 
into the classroom.  However, there is scant information available on 
the learning effectiveness of digital gaming methods compared to 
other classroom techniques.  Hopefully future studies can shed light 
on the importance of digital gaming as an active learning method.

 The University of Tennessee Libraries uses curriculum 
mapping as a tool for departmental information literacy integration.  
UT Libraries successfully integrates information literacy concepts 
and activities into many courses, with less success in science 
courses.  Curriculum mapping gives science librarians a place to 
start when approaching teaching faculty about library instruction.
 As librarians we constantly try to keep up with the ever 
changing curriculum that departments offer.   By systematically 
analyzing the content or focus of the courses in a curriculum, 
librarians can propose the best timing and placement for information 
literacy concepts across a course of study.  Science courses, with 
their emphasis on practical, lab-based work, often lack an intuitive 
placement for information literacy.  Curriculum mapping provides 
the framework for introducing these opportunities to science 
faculty in a meaningful way, with the least amount of compromise 
to the vision of their course.  
 This paper discusses the basics of curriculum mapping, 
the UT Libraries’ application of curriculum mapping in a science 
setting, strategies for implementation, and ways to apply these 
methods at other institutions.
Th e Ba s iCs o f CUr r iC U L U M  Ma p p i n g
 Curriculum mapping originated in the K-12 setting in the 
1500s (Triche & McKnight, 2004).  Schools and school districts use 
curriculum mapping to identify what teachers are actually doing in 
their classrooms and how it aligns to educational standards.  Once 
teachers spend a school year recording their classroom activities, 
they compare their map to the district’s anticipated standards and objectives, and to what other teachers in the same subject and/
or grade are accomplishing in their classrooms.  This systematic 
comparison allows schools and school districts to identify gaps 
and overlap in the K-12 education system and make changes to 
improve teaching. (Koppang, 2004)
 Using curriculum mapping to integrate library use skills, 
and more specifically information literacy, into the higher education 
curriculum differs slightly.  Librarians use curriculum mapping to 
identify relevant and appropriate placement of information literacy 
within a course of study or the general education curriculum.  
This process of collaboration and communication with academic 
departments accomplishes several things: it keeps library services 
relevant to the department and the students, it encourages a similar 
language for discussing information literacy, it acts as a tool for 
marketing to departments, and it creates more authentic (point-of-
need) learning opportunities for students.
Keeping Library Services Relevant
 Academic departments, especially the applied sciences, 
constantly review their curriculum to make sure their graduates are 
prepared and on the cutting edge in their field.  The application of 
curriculum mapping helps librarians make updates quickly so that 
they can suggest changes for the best integration of information 
literacy to help their graduates become competitive and able to 
keep up with the rapidly changing world of information use.  
Speaking Departmental Language
 A common theme among all uses and applications of 
curriculum mapping is improved communication and collaboration.  
Many librarians have experienced situations where they talk to 
faculty members about the importance of information literacy 
only to hear statements such as “I don’t see how this can fit into 
my course/discipline/assignment.”  By becoming familiar with 
the curriculum and learning the vocabulary faculty use to convey hiT Ti n g a Mo v i n g  Ta r g e T: CUr r iC U L U M  Ma p p i n g , in f o r MaTi o n

of information literacy.
Marketing to Departments
 Curriculum mapping can also be used to better market 
library services to departments.  Understanding the department’s 
interests, current initiatives, and changes in the curriculum can 
help librarians revise existing programs or create new ones that 
better fit departmental goals.  
Creating Point-Of-Need Learning Opportunities
 The timing of certain information literacy concepts within 
the course is very important.  Through departmental collaboration 
faculty members become more familiar with information literacy 
and how to integrate it into the curriculum.   This collaboration 
minimizes overlap of content and can reveal creative learning 
opportunities that make information literacy come alive.  Applying 
learning concepts in timely ways that have an immediate practical 
application can create these point-of-need learning opportunities.  
UT’ s ap pLiCaTi o n i n a sCi e nCe seT Ti n g
 The curriculum mapping project at The University of 
Tennessee grew out of a noted need for library instruction for 
science classes.  The Agriculture Library holds many resources 
useful for a wide range of classes – not just writing dependent 
courses.  However, with many natural science courses heavily 
dependent upon laboratory work, an obvious spot within the 
curriculum for library instruction did not exist.  Many students 
used the library only when needed for classes outside the science 
program.  Several one-on-one instruction sessions with science 
students made the need for a more integrated program obvious.
 The library has a good working relationship with both 
the teaching faculty and the research faculty in the Entomology 
and Plant Pathology program.  Working with this small department 
in the College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources 
seemed a good pilot project for many reasons.  Although the 
department offers only masters and doctoral degrees, a handful 
of undergraduate courses are offered in conjunction with the 
Plant Sciences degree.  This department had previously allowed 
the library to conduct a multi-part instruction segment during the 
graduate student introductory seminar course. 
 Diana began the project with an in-depth examination 
of all courses offered for the departmental master’s degree.  She 
identified course requirements and then looked at those courses in 
more detail.  She also considered historical documentation from 
the previously offered multi-part library instruction course and 
more recent “one shot” sessions during the orientation seminar.  
These reviews revealed what was previously considered important 
enough to warrant five to six class sessions and highlighted what 
the professors currently expect their students to know.
 Examining these documents showed, as expected, that the professors wanted to ensure that the students knew how to find the 
most relevant material and how to incorporate that material into 
their research projects.  Faculty requested instruction in the use of 
bibliographic management software several times within the past 
two years.  Examination of course descriptions and available syllabi 
immediately revealed a handful of places for library instruction 
while other opportunities became apparent upon consultation with 
professors or further study of the curriculum.  The undergraduate 
courses because they included a writing component, often a 
research paper, proved most open to new library instruction.  
 Science professors sometimes assume that students learn 
basic research and writing skills in required humanities and social 
science courses.  That is not always the case.  Even with prior 
learning, additional library instruction within science courses 
often proves helpful.  Science courses may have different research/
writing requirements and science-focused library instruction 
becomes beneficial. 
 The curriculum map on the next page shows, in brief form, 
what was presented to several of the professors.  Three of the courses 
currently mapped are represented.

 20    L o e x-2006   -Kr i sTe n a. B U L L a r d a n d di a n a h. h oLd e n-Professor Response
 A positive long-standing relationship between the 
librarians and most of the faculty made it easy to approach both 
the library representative and the individual faculty members.  
Several of the syllabi needed to begin this project were available 
on the departmental website.  Those that were not available 
electronically were easily obtained by a request through the library 
representative.
 After creating an initial curriculum map, Diana circulated 
it to the teaching faculty.  She chose to present this map in non-
library language in order to make it more accessible to the faculty.  
Individual professors received targeted course maps to show how 
the library can be beneficial during the semesters as well as for the 
degree as a whole.   Faculty responded positively.  
 Affirmative feedback focused on the resources available to 
students and the librarian’s willingness to assist with many aspects 
of the learning process.  Several professors plan to implement this 
strategy into teaching their next course (Fall 2006 or Spring 2007).  
Less enthusiastic comments express concern about giving up course 
time for a library session.  Many professors already have trouble 
finding time to cover all of the required course information and 
are unwilling to lose 45-50 minutes.  To date, this time constraint 
has been the biggest obstacle in reaching all of the EPP students.  
Faculty also expressed concern about the relevancy of information 
literacy standards in lab-based courses.  Diana is working to find 
solutions to these obstacles with the hope that by Fall 2007, the 
department will be willing to implement the overall plan.
pLa n n e d  iMpLeMe nTaTi o n sTr aTe g i e s
 This project focused on the master’s level program in 
the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology.  Some of 
the covered courses are jointly offered at the PhD level, but 
Diana felt that more success could be gained with reaching 
students at the beginning of their graduate careers.  The 
transition between undergraduate and graduate work can be 
daunting and intimidating.
 The department offers two main areas of study, 
Entomology and Plant Pathology (EPP).  Within these fields 
students can concentrate in one of eleven sub-specialties.  
This wide range of specialties makes it somewhat difficult to 
create a comprehensive information literacy plan for the entire 
department.
 The Master of Science degree requires 24 hours of 
coursework, two of which must be seminars.  These seminars 
have provided the focus for instructional opportunities to date.  
Students from all of the specialties are represented and they 
all have a required paper to complete.  The seminars are small 
(up to 20 students) and allow the librarian to give an overview 
of library resources, touch on a few databases, and answer 
questions.   Classes never allow enough time to cover everything 
the students need; therefore many consultations with individual 
students can occur over the course of a semester.  The use of 
curriculum mapping will hopefully open some avenues for student 
contact when they most need this help.
Courses Targeted For Initial Contact Are as Follows 
(descriptions are available at http://eppserver.ag.utk.edu/courses.htm): 
 EPP 410 – Diseases and Insects of Ornamental Plants  
 (undergraduate)
EPP 507 – Professional Development Seminar
EPP 512 – Soilborne Plant Pathogens (includes lab)
EPP 514 – Bacterial Plant Diseases (includes lab)
EPP 525 – Medical and Veterinary Entomology (includes 
lab)
EPP 531 – Special Problems in Entomology
 Three of these courses include lab work, which is not 
an obvious place for information literacy work.  However, these 
labs require some written component, whether basic lab notes or 
a more formal paper.  Some of the lab work also requires outside 
investigation of current practices – a skill that application of 
information literacy standards would enhance.
 Because of the class time restraints already mentioned, 
plans have been made to provide the students with some basic 
information and guides that are available at any time. The 
University of Tennessee uses course management software, 
Blackboard, and the professors within EPP use this technology 
enthusiastically.  Diana has provided electronic handouts covering 
basic information about the library and research tips for inclusion 
on the course Blackboard site.  These electronic documents 
incorporate many of the information literacy standards discussed 
above.  Diana is hopeful that as time progresses she will be able to 
make a physical appearance in new classes, as well as provide the 
electronic resources.
 The upcoming fall semester will be the first time Diana 
will be able to incorporate many of the ideas associated with this 
project to a wide range of courses.  The departmental instructors are 
willing to allow her to present in two or three new classes and she 
will take that opportunity to present information literacy concepts 
in ways relevant to what the students are currently working on in 
their degree program.

 Curriculum mapping holds the potential for creatively 
communicating information literacy integration into a wide variety 
of disciplines.  The following steps outline one way this tool may

 course of study.  This might involve gathering   
 syllabi from the department or individual faculty.
•  Analyze individual courses and identify existing   
 information literacy concepts and areas of weakness.
•  Create a draft of a curriculum map which shows the   
 areas where information literacy exists and areas for   
 potential collaboration.  Use the department’s language,  
 avoiding library lingo.
•  Request a meeting with faculty with whom you have  
 a history of good relations.  These faculty can become  
 valuable resources for recruiting the participation of   
 more reluctant faculty.  This meeting    
 will provide the opportunity to articulate your   
 ideas, brainstorm additional avenues for information   
 literacy integration, and receive feedback.
•  Revise your curriculum map to integrate new ideas and  
 suggestions from the faculty, and then start marketing  
 your ideas to the whole department. 
 Keep in mind that this is not a linear process.  Some of 
these steps might be repeated several times with your department.  
Curriculum mapping, as a tool, can continually be revised as the 
department’s curriculum changes, as new ideas are generated and 
as new faculty arrive.  sU M M a rY/Co nC L U s i o n
 This project grew out of a recognized need for a different 
approach to library instruction for the sciences.  By thoroughly 
researching the department requirements, analyzing current courses, 
and meeting with faculty representatives, instruction librarians were 
able to develop a plan that works for the department and for the library.  
The real winners are the students.  They will have greater access to 
the librarians and library resources that can help them succeed in 
their chosen program.  While this type of project cannot be quickly 
completed, it is a worthwhile activity to increase interaction between 
the library and departments that may not have obvious ways of utilizing 
library instruction.

 University of Maryland sophomore, April 2005

 Librarians aim to foster an information-literate population. 
At the same time, we have been grappling with rapidly developing 
technologies and their impact on how we reach our users. In order 
to truly connect with this new techno-savvy generation of students, 
sometimes called “Millennials,” we must strive to understand how 
the students themselves approach information seeking.  How do 
today’s students decide where to look for information, in what 
format, and through which form of interaction? How do students 
evaluate the information they find? Gerri Foudy, Travis Johnson, 
and Neal Kaske, librarians at the University of Maryland (UMD), 
and Dan Wendling, a graduate student in the University’s College 
of Information Studies Program, set out to learn about students’ 
information-seeking behaviors by asking the students themselves. 
Funded by a research grant from the University of Maryland 
Libraries, a research study was developed, which utilized  
individual interviews and focus group interactions, in an attempt 
to begin answering the following research questions: 
• What are contemporary university students’ information- 
 seeking behaviors and what role(s), if any, do libraries  
 and/or librarians play in these behaviors?
• Are these behaviors differentiated by type of    
 information sought – academic versus non-academic?
• What are contemporary students’ mental models of the  
 tasks performed by librarians? • Do these behaviors or mental models differ according to  
 level of matriculation, from freshmen through graduate  
 school? 
BaC Kg r o Un d
 Librarians have endeavored to comprehend user 
information seeking needs and behaviors for many years.  In his 
seminal 1968 article, Robert S. Taylor posited the theory that 
information seeking is a process, not a single event.  The user begins 
the information process before s/he ever enters a library, making 
decisions as the process progresses.  There are two possible paths 
users may take when seeking information in library – working 
through a human intermediary (reference library) or working on 
one’s own. (Taylor, 1968).
 More recently, Eileen Abels investigated business students’ 
views on the role of libraries and librarians in the information seeking 
process. She concluded that a new model of information seeking 
would need to be updated “to reflect the various technological, 
lifestyle, and demographic trends,” and that “rather than consider 
the user, this model considers the information seeker in his or 
her environment.”  Abels’ model includes information inputs and 
influences from many sources outside of the library, including the 
media and agencies and organizations. (Abels, 2004).
 After looking at several models of information seeking, 
we hypothesized that University of Maryland students’ behaviors 
would be influenced greatly by modern technologies.  “Millennials’ 
devotion to the internet has greatly shaped the way they approach 
the research process.  In many cases they start projects by going 
online and browsing around.  When they have questions, they will 
often ping their social network for advice and guidance.” (Rainie, 
2006).  We also were curious as to whether decisions made by 
users when seeking information differed by purpose (academic 
vs. non-academic information needs) and by experience (years of 
matriculation at the University). Further, we wanted to know what is go o g Le go d? h o w do sT Ud e n Ts Lo oK f o r

re s e a r Ch de s i g n
 We decided to use a mixed method approach in 
researching students’ information seeking needs and behaviors.  
We knew from the beginning that we wanted to conduct focus 
group interviews with University of Maryland students drawn 
from all matriculation years, first year through graduate students. 
We later decided to expand our sample population through random 
individual interviews with students on campus. These two different 
approaches would be conducted during the same time period, 
Spring, 2005.
Focus Group Interviews
 We planned to conduct twelve focus group sessions, with 
a maximum of ten students at each session.  There were three 
sessions held for students in four different years of experience at 
the University of Maryland: first-year students, sophomores, junior 
and seniors (as one group), and graduate students. In order to try 
to recruit volunteers from all different colleges and departments 
on campus, we utilized various departmental and university email 
lists.  As an incentive to volunteer for our research study, we 
offered each student a payment of twenty dollars in cash for his or 
her participation. A total of 110 students participated in the focus 
group sessions. (See Table One for a demographic breakdown of 
the participants by year).
Table One: Demographics – Year 
 
 Our focus group interview protocols were designed to help 
answer our research questions:  What are contemporary university 
students’ information-seeking behaviors and what role(s), if any, 
do libraries and/or librarians play in these behaviors; are these 
behaviors differentiated by type of information sought – academic 
versus non-academic; what are contemporary students’ mental models of the tasks performed by librarians; and  do these behaviors 
or mental models differ according to level of matriculation, from 
freshmen through graduate school? 
Focus Group Questions
• When you have an information need related to your   
 studies, where do you look first for information?
• Where do you look second or third for an answer or   
 answers?
• Do you usually look in the same places when you begin  
 looking for course-related information?
• Do you change how you look for information depending  
 on the subject or type of information you need?
• Do you always look in the same places in the same   
 order?
• Do you usually do your information gathering on your  
 own or do you ask for help?
• If you do ask for help, whom do you ask?
• If you have worked with a library staff member, what  
      did he or she do to help or hinder your search for   
 information?
• If you do not ask library staff members for help, why   
 not?
 We used the same questions about students’ searching 
processes for information for an academic purpose and students’ 
searching processes for information for a non-academic purpose. 
(See Appendix A for detailed focus group interview questions and 
protocol).

 Students in the Spring 2005 semester of the University 
of Maryland’s College of Information Studies class LBSC 713 
conducted random individual interviews with students they 
encountered in common areas of the campus (student union, study 
rooms, etc.), however, not in any of the libraries. 256 students 
were interviewed over a one-week period in April 2005. For such 
random selection, we were pleased to find that the students were 
fairly even distributed by year (see Table Two on the right)

Individual Interview Questions
• Please think of a recent time when you needed to   
 find information or do research for a class.  What was  
  the information you needed, or the topic of your   
 research?
• Where did you go or look?
– What did you find, and how did you locate it?
•  Where did you go next?
– What did you find, and how did you locate it?
(See Appendix B for Individual Interview form)
fi n d i n g s
 Perhaps predictably, a majority of students who were 
individually interviewed stated that they conducted a remote 
search when beginning their school-related research. However, 
we were somewhat surprised to discover that eighty two out of 
174 remote searchers began with the UMD’s libraries’ web site, 
as compared with forty seven students who began with a major 
search engine, such as Google. Seventy one students of the 259 
participants reported going to the library to begin their research, 
however, only one student said that he or she interacted with a 
librarian. (See Table Three) One our research questions was to discover whether students’ 
searching patterns and behaviors changed as they had more years 
of education. One finding that stands out is that graduate students 
are more likely to conduct remote searches and far less likely than 
undergraduates to visit the library.  (See Table Four).
 Where does Google come in for complex (multi-step) 
academic searching? From our surveys, 141 of 256 students looked 
in more than one place for course-related information (the other 
115 found what they needed in one try):
31% started with a Research Port (Library database) search
 - 8.5% started with Research Port, then Google 
23% started at the physical library
 - 7% started at the library, then went to Google
16% started with a Google search
 - 7% started with Google then went to the library
 The responses in the focus group sessions relating to 
the students’ first research step when looking for information for 
an academic purpose did not differ greatly from the individual 
interview results.  A majority of the students preferred to begin 
their searches remotely.  “I usually go with the most efficient way, 
usually the same thing every time.  If it’s school related I go to 
the library, if it’s everyday stuff I go to Google. I just need to find

 For many students, the decision to use the UMD Libraries’ 
web site is based on their assessment as to the level of authoritativeness 
needed for their research. Others report that their instructors require 
that they use library resources, “always the library first for my classes.” 
(UMD sophomore).  Several students described using Google and other 
search engines rather the same way researchers of earlier generations 
used printed tertiary sources such as encyclopedias, to learn more 
in general about a subject before trying to search for more specific 
information. “I use Google more to find out what my topic’s about so 
I know what I’m looking for when I have to narrowly tailor a search.” 
(UMD junior).
Co nC L U s i o n s
 Convenience, speed, and currency were the most important 
factors for students’ when deciding where to look for information. 
Stated one UMD graduate student during a focus group session,“If a 
journal article is not available online, even if it is a very good article, I 
will not use it.” These findings are consistent with most of the research 
into this latest generation of students’ information seeking behaviors. 
“Millennials’ devotion to the internet has greatly shaped the way they 
approach the research process.  In many cases they start projects by 
going online and browsing around.  When they have questions, they 
will often ping their social network for advice and guidance.” (Pew, 
2006).
 What do students think about librarians? They really 
don’t think of us at all. During the focus group interviews, very few 
students reported having interacted with a librarian, either in person 
or electronically.  The students expressed a strong desire to be able to 
conquer the research process on their own (or think that they know it 
all already).  As one participant noted, “In the real world I am going 
to have to learn to do it by myself.” (UMD junior). Students reported 
turning to their peers for advice, often using technologies such as 
instant messaging, email, and online courseware discussion sections.  
Although almost 100% of the students in the focus groups reported 
using instant messaging very frequently, they consider it to be a social 
medium as well.  When asked if they would like to be able to IM their 
professors or librarians, most of the students were opposed to these 
older people impinging on their IM social circle.
 What do students think about the physical libraries on 
campus?  During the focus group interviews many students expressed 
being intimidated or frustrated by the size and complexities of their 
physical layouts, especially what many view as the impossibility of 
being able to find books on the shelves.  One sophomore called the 
library “a dense jungle of paper and ink.”  Since this new generation of 
students grew up using the computer for doing research instead of going 
to a library, it is not surprising that college students feel overwhelmed 
by a large research library, and rely on their old pal the Internet when 
searching for information.fUrTh e r sTe p s
 Our research study findings have given us a lot of insight 
into the information seeking behaviors and patterns of UMD students. 
The data gathered here can have implications for the Libraries’ web 
site design, public services, and make us rethink they layout of the 
Libraries themselves.  It also should make us consider how we are 
teaching our information literacy classes.  Are we recognizing the 
inherent cognitive differences in this new generation of students and 
adapting our program accordingly?  
 “Nearly four-fifths of college students (79%) agree that 
Internet use has had a positive impact on their college academic 
experience.” (Pew. 2002) Our students have grown up with and 
embrace the Internet. Librarians should just accept already that the 
Internet is a viable research tool, and integrate use of the Internet 
into instruction.” Like all students, they learn more effectively when 
taught in accordance with their learning style preferences and when 
their worldviews are acknowledged.” (Manuel. 2002).  Don’t treat the 
Internet as a separate, distinct source of information and lecture about 
its validity. Manuel describes an information literacy program at New 
Mexico State University that replaced lectures on using and evaluating 
Internet sources with active, discovery learning opportunities. (Manuel.  
2002). Such an approach has the added benefit of helping to develop 
critical thinking skills. 
 We should be teaching the students how to search the Internet 
more effectively. Most of the students in our focus groups did not use 
advanced Boolean operators, or advanced search screens within the 
search engines. “I pretend that I know what I am doing.” (UMD junior). 
Since we know that our students prefer to be self-learners, we should 
also put more effort into the effectiveness of our online guides, signage, 
and library websites to help students navigate both the physical and 
virtual sources of information more effectively.
 As rapidly as technology changes, so will the perceptions 
and skills of our students.  It is important to find out how our students 
are seeking information, and adapt ourselves accordingly.

 In 1996, a two-course General Education communication 
requirement was implemented at the University of Wisconsin 
– Madison.  Both courses have campus-mandated information 
literacy modules.  The tutorial CLUE was developed for the first of 
these two courses in which 75% of our freshman class (ca. 3,500-
4,000 students) are annually enrolled.  All students in this course 
are required to complete CLUE before attending a library session 
taught by a librarian in which the basic resources, research strategies 
and skills are put into the context of the research process.
or i g i n a L CLUe T U To r i a L
 The original CLUE tutorial, which debuted in 1995, was 
designed using AuthorWare and was delivered via a stand-alone 
CD.  In 2000, it was updated using Flash and delivered online.  
Structurally CLUE was divided into three modules: “Info Power 
Tools”, “MadCat” (our local OPAC), and “Indexes.”  Each module 
began with the voice of a student discussing research problems 
they were having.  This was followed by a demonstration of how 
these problems were resolved.  Each module ended with a ‘your 
turn’ component that got students into an online resource such as 
our OPAC or an index.  Finally, students had to demonstrate their 
new-found knowledge by successfully completing three quizzes. 
 By 2004 it was clear that CLUE needed to be revised.  
The Weblog statistics suggested that students were going directly 
to the quizzes and bypassing the modules.  They were taking the 
quizzes multiple times until they achieved the required score.   A 
UW-Madison study that assessed freshman research behavior 
indicated that students were impatient with college-level research 
skills – opting to quickly abandon the use of library tools, such as catalogs and journal databases, for their tool of choice, Google.  In 
addition to updating the look and feel of CLUE, we realized that 
the tutorial needed to provide students with reasons to learn new 
search skills and use new research tools.   Google had worked for 
them throughout high school; they needed to be convinced that 
there was still more for them to learn.
re s o UrCe s ne e d e d  To re v i s e  CLUe
 
 The project took exactly one year.  Staff involved included 
three librarians who brought diverse skills and learning styles to the 
project.  This diversity resulted in longer discussions but a more well-
balanced tutorial. Two instructional design consultants assisted in 
several phases of the project.  A graphic artist came in toward the end 
of the project to fine tune the look of the tutorial container.  All told, 
the project involved 500+ hours of library staff time.  Funding for staff 
and equipment (e.g., a high quality microphone for recording sound) 
was provided by the library.  A small instructional design grant helped 
cover costs for usability testing.
re v i s i o n  pr oCe s s
 The original revision plan for CLUE had three objectives: 
to address the “buy-in” issue mentioned earlier and to update the 
look and feel of the tutorial and the examples used in it.  For the 
most part, as we reviewed each module, we focused on revising 
the strategies and updating the tone of each module; we did not 
think the tutorial’s learning objectives would need to be revised 
since we had been adding to or revising the original objectives 
as library resources changed.  Late in the fall we brought in an 
instructional design consultant who suggested our revision process 
was backwards.  Instead of looking at strategies, we needed to 
focus on our learning objectives.  Once we started to deconstruct 
the objectives of the old CLUE, the problems became clear:  our 
affective objective was vague and unpersuasive (i.e., “you need to 
do this to succeed”) which explained the lack of buy-in; we had far 
too many objectives for each module and steps for each process; LeT Ti n g go & s Ta rTi n g ov e r: Th e Tr a n s f o r MaTi o n o f a n

module resulted in confusion—for us as well as for our students!  
Two months into the process, we realized we could not simply 
revise the old CLUE.  Instead, we would need to start over and 
recreate the tutorial from start to finish — a stunning realization 
since this meant we were now facing a much bigger project than 
originally anticipated.
 So our process of revision became one of transformation.  
We started by writing new objectives, then identifying critical 
content for those objectives, and then and only then  did we turn 
our attention to learning strategies.  
ne w fe aT Ur e s o f CLUe  (http://clue.library.wisc.edu /)
 
 In designing the new CLUE we paid a great deal of attention 
to changing the look and feel of the tutorial.  As students told us in 
usability testing, the new look is less busy, lighter, more engaging to 
Net Gen learners.  The structure of the tutorial also changed.  There are 
now five rather than three modules with a new module that tackles the 
buy-in issue head on and a separate, new module that orients students 
to the campus library system.  We also created a module that addresses 
transferable search strategies instead of trying to cover both strategies 
and resources in the same module.  The content is tighter and, as a 
result, it takes students about 45 minutes to an hour to complete, half 
the time of the older version.
Mo dU Le 1: “B U Y-i n” 
 One of the more significant changes in the new CLUE is 
the creation of a separate buy-in module that introduces students 
to the tutorial.  Unlike in the old CLUE, here our “carrot/stick” 
approach is clearly defined: students are congratulated on being 
admitted to our premiere research university but then cautioned 
that, because they are here, they will have to meet new and higher 
expectations.  The message is also clearly defined:  high school 
and college research are different and students will need to learn 
new skills to do research successfully.  Finally, we took a different 
approach to the perennial question of who should be the voice of 
authority:  faculty deliver the message about new expectations 
and then pass the baton of authority over to a librarian who is 
introduced as someone who can help students learn how to meet 
those expectations.  Students responded positively to the fact that 
we used real faculty and real librarians in the module. The faculty 
who participated in the module were sincerely enthusiastic about 
the module’s message and indicated they would use CLUE in their 
own classes.
Mo dU Le 2:  o r i e n TaTi o n
 Another major new feature of CLUE is a dual-
purpose orientation module that we call, “ Your  UW Madison 
Libraries.”  In this module we wanted to provide students 
with a general overview of the campus library system and 
its superb resources and services.  We also wanted them to 
feel somewhat anxious about the vast number and variety of resources available to them.  Once again, we employ the 
carrot/stick approach to motivate students, continuing the 
affective goals of Module One.
 For many of the images used, we turned to our campus 
digital photograph collection and then supplemented these with 
our own images.  Because pictures with a voice-over did not pack 
the emotional punch we wanted, we decided to add music in order 
to transform the module into an “experience” rather than simply a 
narrative.  Initially our instructional design consultant was skeptical 
about our decision to use music, since from a design perspective, 
music can create dissonance for online learners.  However, even 
he was won over when he heard the relaxing, lyric-free music, and 
said that, in this case, our choice actually enhanced learning. 
Mo dU Le 3: s e p a r a Te sTr aTe g i e s
 
 “Module Three:  Five Research Strategies” is also a 
response to some of the problems encountered with the “old” 
CLUE.  While deconstructing the original learning objectives, 
we realized it was unrealistic to expect students to learn effective 
search strategies at the same time they were being introduced to 
unfamiliar tools such as the catalog and journal databases.  As a 
result, we decided to cover five specific search strategies separately 
from the tools themselves.  We chose strategies that can be used 
alone or in combination and that, most importantly, will work in 
the majority of the search tools students are likely to encounter. 
 We had also learned from a previous study that Google 
defines many of our incoming students’ understanding of the world 
of information in general and of the search process in particular.  
So, it seemed wise pedagogically to build on what students already 
knew about searching via Google, rather than ignore or disparage 
the one tool many of them felt comfortable using.  The result is 
that we use Google as a touchstone or point of comparison for 
introducing new resources and strategies whenever possible.  
 When we showed our instructional design consultant the 
original rapid prototype for this module, he was distracted by all 
the text, tabs, buttons, and branding that are part and parcel of most 
database interfaces.   In fact, because of all this “noise,” he was 
unable  to concentrate on the main learning objectives at hand, the 
strategies themselves.  Given this response, we decided to create 
our own “Generic Database,” rather than spend inordinate amounts 
of time “doctoring” real interface screens to fit our pedagogical 
needs.  The resulting screen is very bare bones, but it avoids any 
possibility for confusion as to where the eye should focus. It also 
serves to further enforce the concept that regardless of what a 
database looks like, the strategies being covered in this module 
will still apply. 
Mo dU Le s 4 a n d 5: L iBr a r Y re s e a r Ch To oLs
 The remaining modules explore how to effectively 
access and make use of two specific resources:  MadCat (our 
OPAC) and the library’s journal databases.  No explanation 
Lo e x-2006    33 -LeT Ti n g go & s Ta rTi n g ov e r:...-is given for the search strategies employed in these modules 
since successful completion of Module Three is assumed.  An 
interesting point regarding Module Four is that we decided 
to re-contextualize the online catalog by way of describing 
the “old fashioned” card catalog. This idea was inspired by a 
presentation at LOEX 2005 by Mary Elizabeth Barbosa-Jerez.1   
And, indeed, students in our usability testing told us that they 
do find this analogy quite helpful.
ra p i d pr oToT Yp e s a n d Ca pTi v aTe2
 In the old days of Authorware and Flash programming, 
the CLUE prototypes were sketched on paper before they 
became digital creations.  With the advent of tools such as 
Captivate, the need to figure it all out on paper ceased to be 
an imperative.  Instead, we developed Flash prototypes using 
Captivate software.  This software captures what happens on 
a computer screen and produces a PowerPoint-like editing 
environment in which images and sound, including narration, 
can be added to the slides.  Each slide can be edited, and every 
object can be changed, repositioned, or resized with simple 
mouse clicks, including mouse paths!  For each module, we 
created one Captivate movie or file which was then published 
as a self-contained Flash (swf) movie.  Captivate allowed us to 
embed quiz questions throughout a module, which prevented 
students from going right to the quiz without first completing 
the module.   The main disadvantages associated with Captivate 
include the typical ‘beta’ bugs and limited features associated 
with newer applications. 
Us aBiLiT Y Te sTi n g
 After developing rapid prototypes, we enlisted the help 
of 25 undergraduate students to test these prototypes.  We gave 
them book store certificates in exchange for an hour of their time.   
During these usability tests, we asked students to work through the 
prototypes of the various modules and to think out loud as to what 
they were seeing and feeling.  This feedback was invaluable in 
letting us know if we were on the right track and in helping us edit 
the prototypes.   After editing we would do more usability testing 
and obtain additional feedback.   Ultimately, we merged all user 
feedback comments into a single document and then met to review 
each comment and decide what should be changed and when.  In 
September of 2005, the new version of CLUE was linked from the 
Libraries’ Web site.
as s e s s Me nT
 
 In late fall of 2005, we distributed Web surveys to students 
and instructors in the Communication A course in which CLUE and a 
follow-up library session were required.  240 students and 39 instructors 
completed the survey.  The results were generally positive.
• Time to complete CLUE:  58% of the respondents   
 indicated it took between 30 and 60 minutes to complete   the entire tutorial.
• 92% indicated that CLUE prepared them for the   
              follow-up library session.  For those who did not feel   
 prepared, the problem was largely one of scheduling by  
 instructors who assigned CLUE long before the follow- 
 up class.  Ideally, the interval between the two should be  
 no more than a week.
• When asked what they had learned from CLUE, “search  
 strategies” were most frequently mentioned, then the   
 library system, followed (somewhat to our bemusement)  
 by truncation.  
• When asked what they liked best about CLUE, the       
 majority of respondents (111) selected “easy to follow/ 
 clear (content).”
• When asked what they would change about the tutorial,  
 the most frequent response was that CLUE was “too   
 long.”  Since most students complete CLUE in   
 under an hour, we suspect that this concern may reflect  
 unrealistic expectations on the part of some of   
 our students in terms of how long it    
 takes to learn a new library system—an expectation we  
 will work with instructors to address more explicitly in  
 the fall.   A number of students commented on the fact  
 that CLUE covered a lot of information, too much for  
 them to remember.
• When asked what parts of CLUE helped them most with  
 their research assignments, the most frequent responses  
 were “strategies,” followed by our database    
 gateway, and then our online catalog.  Comments to this   
              category were particularly gratifying:  “I actually learned   
 how to use the Madison system; I love the libraries now,  
 and research is a lot easier.”  Or “It let me know that   
 there was more out there than just the Internet or books.”
• Finally, when asked what helped them most with their  
 research, 11% of the respondents said CLUE, 35% said  
 the library session, 51% said CLUE and the library   
 session in combination, and 4% said neither.  The mixed  
 response is similar to the feedback we    
 received for earlier iterations of CLUE and reflects the  
 diverse learning style preferences of our students.  
Co nC L U s i o n
 The planning process used for transforming CLUE has 
proven so successful that it is now being applied to other instruction 
projects such as the redesign of the campus instruction Web 
site and in developing new lesson plans for existing courses.

 A recent advertisement for Berlitz International (Berlitz) 
showed a German coast guard who receives an SOS from a sinking 
ship.  “We are sinking”, the crew pleads, to which the German 
guard responds, “What are you sinking about?” 
 This video is a powerful illustration of the complexity 
surrounding communication.  It is evident that proficiency goes 
beyond the ability to read and write.  As a result, international 
students can find themselves in confusing and unpleasant 
interactions with information professionals.  IL sessions, even 
when simplified, can seem complicated:  not only terminology is 
an issue, but so is the manner of its delivery.  Learning differences 
and cultural influences can sure muddy the waters.
 Here, I suggest that offering non-English IL will not only 
help eliminate miscommunication, but also augment the experience 
of international student.  Some research certainly suggests “Native 
Language” instruction (Boer, Liestman and Wu, Natowitz); 
however, there’s little evidence of a commitment to non-English 
information literacy instruction for international students on our 
campuses.  Some possible reasons are mentioned in the literature 
discussion below.LiTe r a T Ur e a n d iL f o r inTe r n a Ti o n a L sT Ud e n Ts:
There’s a relatively small body of literature regarding IL for 
international students.  An analysis of 18 core articles identifies 3 
themes: culture, technology, and language (Natowitz).
The Cultural Discussion :   
 It is difficult to discuss any issues surrounding international 
students without including a discussion of cultural differences.  
Natowitz states:
 Implicit in the literature is the question of whether   
 international students will be seen as library users   
 lacking  the requisite cultural background, or as   
 representatives of unique and valuable cultures,   
 whose differences ought to be understood, responded to,  
 and even appreciated. (p.5) 
 We believe that the time to respond to this question has 
come. International students represent different cultural values.  
Still, while many librarians recognize this fact, IL programs 
continue to be designed to help the students assimilate to our 
learning culture rather than consider changing our own teaching 
to fit their needs.  Why do we need to do this?  For one thing, 
it is important that international students feel comfortable and 
confident in their interactions.  This is most likely to happen 
when they language is not an obstacle.  Further, there’s evidence 
that teaching in native language increases the learning outcome 
(Liestman and Wu).  Teaching non-English IL can also increase the 
library’s visibility and its outreach efforts. 
The Technology Discussion :   
 Research has also discussed the issue of technological 
divide, which remains somewhat relevant – depending on the 
geography.  Today, however, technology proliferation makes Lo sT i n Tr a n s LaTi o n? inTe r n a Ti o n a L sT Ud e n Ts a n d no n-

that recent surveys show consistently higher levels of computer 
literacy. (Jackson).  This makes it difficult to generalize and/or 
predict the incoming skills of the students. 
The Language Discussion :  
 This area seemed to generate the most debate, perhaps 
because it is more closely linked to the issue of communication.  
Feldman asserts that reading and writing proficiency doesn’t correlate 
with oral proficiency (p. 164).  This is one of the reasons why English 
instruction may be problematic.  Many of the students have higher 
reading and writing proficiencies and tend to rely on this when 
learning the language.  Oral proficiency is developed in time and 
that’s one of the luxuries that one-hour IL sessions cannot afford.  
 Instead of non-English instruction, however, most articles 
suggest techniques for enhancing communication in English, 
such as using simple terminology and/or speaking more slowly.  
This makes covering essential research in one hour a challenging 
task.    Additionally, there are issues that deal with differences in 
linguistic structure that complicate information retrieval efforts 
(see Jacobson p.27).  
Suggestions and Concerns :
 Unfortunately, research on IL for international students 
needs to be brought more up to date, especially in regards to 
technology and cultural concerns. However, there are some 
great suggestions on designing IL programs for the international 
student population: creating specialized tutorials or subject guides, 
redesigning contents, building partnerships, improving outreach, 
and training staff.  
 In terms of offering native instruction, there were concerns 
dealing with choosing a language of instruction and the sustainability 
of such service.  Some also felt that native instruction might be a 
disservice, since the students learning environment is in English.
 Whatever the case may be, literature makes it clear that IL 
instruction needs to be framed within all three areas discussed above.

 Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man 
to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.   --A Chinese Proverb
The question here is: what is a fish?
 In 2005, at a lecture at the McKay School of Education, 
Brigham Young University, Dr. Bransford answers this question 
elegantly by using Leo Lionni’s children story “Fish is Fish”.  The 
story tells us about a frog who returns to a pond to tell the fish 
about what she saw on dry land.  As the story unfolds, the fish 
envisions humans, birds, and other creatures with fins or gills.  Dr. Bransford explains that our world of knowledge is doesn’t exist 
in a vacuum; that learners bring “previously acquired knowledge, 
correct or erroneous”. (Bransford).   
 
 Information Literacy librarians understand this, but 
imagine what would happen if, instead of a frog describing what 
he’d seen, we chose a fish to narrate to fish.  
 The students will have plenty of time to develop and learn 
vocabulary that will help them with their research because they 
know it will be necessary to navigate databases.  However, they 
won’t be as successful if they didn’t understand the basics to begin 
with.
Th e pLa n n i n g  pr oCe s s: 
Where We Were: 1997 - Present :
 The University Library System had a long history 
of collaboration with departments that deal with International 
Students:  
 The English Language Institute collaborates with our 
librarians to offer information literacy sessions that are designed 
to introduce international students to the research process at an 
American University.  These sessions include library tours, database 
training, and a hands-on period with access to a librarian for one 
on one assistant with their research questions.  These sessions are 
taught in English and are mandatory.  However, this population is 
much smaller and only includes students who’ve been required to 
attend the institute for further language training.  
 At OIS, our sessions were invitational and poorly 
attended, including our non-English IL effort, even though they 
reached a much larger group of students.  The program needed 
revamp and a new marketing strategy.   
Language Selection :
 The choice of language depended on two critical factors:  
enrollment and staff availability.
Revisiting Enrollment Demographics :
 According to 1984-2004 figures from OIS, there’s an 
increase (though sporadic) in international student enrollment.  
Asian students represent the largest demographics, followed by 
Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.  Of the Asian 
population, China comes first, followed by S. Korea, then Japan 
(see figures 1-3).  Enrollment demographics pointed to Asia and 
Latin America as two service populations.

 As for instructors, we are fortunate to house two 
nationally known collections: East Asian and Latin American.  For 
these reason, we were able to find skilled staff that can provide 
instruction in the targeted language.  We chose to focus on Asian, 
and later hope to add Spanish.  In terms of sustainability, this is a 
non-issue regarding these particular languages.
The Instruction Sessions :
 Regarding the sessions, we decided to offer a variety 
of instructional methods:  there was a tour component, a brief 
lecture, and a hands-on interactive exercise portion.  This allowed 
for maximum interaction which personalized the session, while 
ensuring that basic concepts were grasped.  
 In terms of scheduling the sessions, the sessions were 
offered as part of their orientation and they had the choice of 
attending a non-English session or the English session.  We noticed 
the English session dropped slightly, while attendance of the non-
English sessions increased.  However, there were students that 
attended both sessions.
Where We Were: 2004 - Present :
 Today, we offer instruction for international students in 
both English and Non-English.  This service is designed to be 
more interactive and personal by increasing the mode of learning 
via tours, lecture, and hands-on experience.  The sessions have 
been well received.
oUr ex p e r i e n Ce:
 The sessions :  Generally there was a 2% increase in 
attendance in the Chinese and Korean sessions, and 4% in the 
Japanese.  In terms of satisfaction, 53% found the sessions extremely 
useful, and 33% found them useful (there’s a notable difference 
between the level of satisfaction of international students and the 
general student population.  The results of satisfaction surveys for 
other students indicated that only 16% found the session extremely 
useful, and 49% rated it useful.  Taking into account that this 
population included international students, the satisfaction gap 
might even be larger for the general population).  
The Students :
 In terms of the international students’ perception of self-
efficacy, it was interesting to see that the trends mirrored those 
of the general student population (again, taking into account that 
this population included international students, the difference in 
perception might be larger for the general population):
 Important to note, are the discrepancies between their 
perception of efficacy and the challenges they face in terms of 
acquiring the information they need.  Also noteworthy is that 
the students remain relatively hesitant to ask for help.  Another 
opportunity for research would be to survey these students at a later 
point in the term to measure the change in their attitude towards 
seeking help from a librarian.
Challenges :
 Regarding the challenges discussed in literature, the resources 
available at our university provided for a unique opportunity to manage 
this program.  In terms of sustainability, we find ourselves fortunate to have 
skilled librarians and collections that match our student demographics.  
The most challenge we faced was in providing instruction for smaller 
demographics of students, such as Arabic and Turkish.  However, we do 
offer one on one instruction on a need basis.
 As for the question of this form of IL being a disservice to 
students in terms of learning English, it is unfounded.  There were 
a couple of reasons for this statement:  first, international students 
continued to attend English sessions (such as ELI) during the rest of 
their learning experience; second, we feel that acquiring the language 
is a long term goal and is also beyond the focus of information literacy.  
We are more concerned with increasing the students’ comprehension of 
basic research concepts, their confidence, and the visibility of librarians 
and services, among other things such as the presence of diversity and 
cultural inclusion.

 Librarians recognize the need for creating specialized 
IL programs for International Students.  Here in the U.S., 
however, these programs tend to focus on content delivery and are 
administered in English.  This presentation illustrates how non-
English IL sessions at the University of Pittsburgh enhance the

students in higher education is a compelling reason for academic 
librarians to collaborate with their K-12 colleagues in developing 
information literacy activities across K-20 education.”
(Carr & Rockman, 2003, p. 52)
 For the past three years, librarians at Kent State University 
have been working with high school library media specialists, educators 
and students to aid information literacy instruction. This work has 
been supported, in part, by The Institute for Library and Information 
Literacy Education (ILILE). The Institute is federally funded through 
the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and the U.S. 
Department of Education, and was established at Kent State University 
to provide leadership: 
• In fostering collaboration among K-12 teachers and library  
 media specialists 
• In advancing information literacy in the K-12 curriculum.
 Three partners comprise ILILE: the College of Education, 
the School of Library & Information Science, and University Libraries. 
Each directs projects intended to foster information literacy in K-12 
in Ohio and nationally. This work has already produced useful tools 
and model programs, and just as importantly, it has revealed many 
insights into the K-12 information literacy culture and how teachers 
and librarians prepare students for college.  
BaC Kg r o Un d
 
 In the past few years, a number of concerns have arisen in higher 
education regarding the preparedness of students and performance of 
universities. Certainly, the reader would recognize these problems, as 
they are not unique to Ohio. They involve the buzzwords: retention, 
remediation, alignment and funding. Higher education’s response to these concerns has been to create first-year experience programs that 
focus on the preparation and support of incoming students. At Kent 
State, we began to see our work with high schools as a component 
of the first-year experience that worked on several fronts to connect 
K-12 education with higher education. We realized that by supporting 
library media specialists, teachers and students at the high school 
level, we could impact student preparation for college. The following 
summarizes some of the most important insights and lessons we have 
learned through our collaborative work with high schools in Ohio.
in s i g h Ts ga i n e d  / L e s s o n s  Le a r n e d
1. Budgetary considerations directly influence 
collaborative opportunities.
 
At the high school level, fluctuations in federal, state and 
local funding can have an effect on information literacy 
instruction. In Ohio, many library media specialists 
worry about their security within the educational system, 
since the state’s Operating Standards for Schools do not 
mandate a librarian for every school. Limited resources 
sometimes present administrators with the challenge of 
choosing between a nurse and library media specialist.  
Funding levels also impact whether schools can afford 
field trips. We have had schools visit Kent State one year 
and then not be able to afford to return the next.  We 
have also seen the size of groups increase on visits, since 
schools that can afford a bus for a field trip want to fill 
them with as many students as possible. 
2. Information literacy appears in state standards and 
begins with K-2.
 
In Ohio, standards drive K-12 education. Benchmarks 
for information literacy appear within the TechnologyoUr Tr a n s i Ti o n Mi s s i o n :  r e aCh i n g oU T To Th e hi g h sCh o o L

 42    L o e x-2006   -Ke n BUr h a n n a , M a rY Le e Je n s e n , a n d Ba rBa r a sChLoMa n-standards, beginning at the K-2 level and continuing 
through grades 9-12. Information literacy is also 
integrated into the academic content standards, such 
as Science, Language Arts and Social Studies. These 
standards offer opportunities for collaboration with 
library media specialists, providing common ground 
for discussion, programming and assessment projects. 
3. Like academic librarians, library media specialists 
often must collaborate to access students.
Just as we need to collaborate with faculty members 
to integrate information literacy into courses, library 
media specialists must do the same. More than once we 
have been contacted directly by teachers, who had left 
their school librarians out of the loop on planning a visit. 
We have made it our policy to try to bring the library 
media specialist back into these conversations and help 
build healthy teacher – librarian collaborations.
4. Library media specialists have their own professional 
associations, regional groups and consortia.
Like academic librarians, library media specialists have 
a strong national association within ALA, the American 
Association of School Librarians (AASL), as well as an active state AASL affiliate. INFOhio, the information 
network for Ohio schools, coordinates the acquisition 
of online library resources at the state level. 
We were also surprised to learn of other regional 
organizations and state agencies that play a strong 
role in the education and support of librarians and 
library media centers. For example the Ohio Education 
Computer Network has 24 regional sites providing 
data and technical support to school districts. Many 
of these also provide a forum for discussions and 
offer programming for library media specialists. Each 
of these associations and organizations can provide 
opportunities to connect with and share information 
with groups of school librarians. 
5. Professional associations provide a framework for 
information literacy.
The professional associations for both academic 
librarians and library media specialists (ACRL and 
AASL) provide a framework of standards around which 
we can design and deliver instruction. A comparison of 
the standards (see Figure 1) shows modest differences. 
Overall, the ACRL standards align well with those of the 
AASL, demonstrating further that academic and school 
librarians have very similar instructional objectives.

1. Accesses information effectively and 
efficiently. 
2. Evaluates information critically.

The Results of Our Collaborations: Programs and Projects
Informed Transitions: Kent State University’s 
Library Outreach Program to High Schools6. Exposure to academic libraries can reduce anxiety  
 and may help with recruitment. 
Throughout our outreach work with high schools, one 
objective has been to give visiting students a positive 
experience using the academic library. If students feel too 
intimidated or confused to even venture into their college 
library or ask a question, there will be less opportunity to 
reach them. Visits can also serve as a powerful recruitment 
tool when the library visit is combined with campus tours 
and admission office visits. 
7. Library media specialists are eager and willing to 
collaborate.
We saved this point for last because it represents perhaps 
our most rewarding discovery. Library media specialists, 
despite their limited resources and tight schedules, are open and willing to work with academic librarians. 
Preparing students for college success is very important to 
them. We found that the way we talk about our freshmen 
is very similar to how library media specialists talk about 
their seniors. In fact, when meeting with library media 
specialists they are eager to ask us specific questions 
about college preparation: What’s the best style manual 
to teach? Which databases will students be asked to 
use in their first year? Library media specialists have 
also proven quick to make connections, putting other 
colleagues in touch with us and inviting us to speak at 
regional and state meetings. Consider contacting library 
media specialists local to your college or university and 
introducing yourself. Even if an outreach-collaboration 
doesn’t evolve, you’ll gain helpful insights into how your 
colleagues in K-12 education are preparing your future 
students.
 44    L o e x-2006   -Ke n BUr h a n n a , M a rY Le e Je n s e n , a n d Ba rBa r a sChLoMa n- At the local level, we took the momentum and 
knowledge we gained through our ILILE grant work and 
formalized our library’s outreach program to local high 
schools. We had been informally working with local high 
schools for a number of years, but with the help of the grant, 
we were able to create an instructional classroom devoted to 
visits by high school students. We named our outreach program 
Informed Transitions ( www.kent.library.edu/highschoo l). Its 
overall mission is to ease student transitions to college, with 
special emphasis on library experiences. The program has the 
following specific objectives:
• Build on, reinforce and introduce important   
  information literacy skills
• Lower student anxiety related to large libraries and  
  college-level resources
• Help students succeed in the near-term on their high  
  school assignments
• Create a collaborative framework between academic  
  and school librarians
• Promote higher education in general, KSU   
  specifically.
ho w Th e pr o g r a M wo rKs
 Library media specialists and teachers contact us with 
visit requests and then we collaborate with them to design a 
lesson plan and objectives. Whenever possible, we attempt 
to involve both teacher and librarian in the process. Here are 
some key questions to consider when planning a high school 
visit:
 
1. Do the students have an assignment?  An assignment 
tied to the students’ high school curriculum that 
requires college level resources is a great mandate 
around which to build a lesson.
2. Does the school have other specific objectives?  
Sometimes in addition to an assignment or in place 
of one, schools wish to introduce students to specific 
aspects of academic libraries, like how the Library of 
Congress classification system works or an overview 
of library services. 
3. What is the size of the group?  We have tried to keep 
group sizes to 25 or lower, but recently we’ve seen 
group sizes increase due to budgetary concerns.
4. Will students need borrowing privileges?  We will 
provide borrowing privileges to high schools with 
administrative approval.
ea rL Y re sU L T s 
 During the first two years of Informed Transitions , 
over 700 high school students have visited the Kent State 
Library. While we have yet to formally assess the program, 
we have received feedback and indications that we are making a difference. One graduate of Aurora High School returned to 
thank her school librarian for taking her class on a visit to the 
KSU library. The student reported feeling a step ahead when 
she needed to begin research for a term paper. Stories of these 
visits can carry strong influence with administrators in both 
high school and college. We have also noticed high school 
students returning independently to use the library during 
evenings and weekends, and we have met first-year students 
at Kent State who have told us they visited with a high school 
class previously. 
 We can list several reasons to consider collaborating 
with local high schools as we have with Informed Transitions , 
but one important observation does a good job of summing up 
their value. Last year, a colleague approached us after a visit 
and asked, “What class were you working with today? I looked 
in and they were hanging on your every word.”  
 “They weren’t from Kent State,” we said. “They were 
a group of high school students.” 
 My colleague was amazed. She shook her head. “I 
wish our own students would engage at that level,” she told us. 
“What do you think the difference is?”
 We thought about her question, and it was true. During 
high school visits, the students are engaged and enthused. 
They follow directions and work hard. On the other hand, our 
own students sometimes seem distracted and to lack focus. We 
have come to believe that high school students are open and 
receptive to academic library experiences in ways they may 
not be when they return as first-year students. In the three 
months that separate high school from college, they have 
gained their independence and their priorities have shifted. 
But as high school students, they are enjoying a field trip and 
have gotten out of their normal classes to explore a university. 
A high school class visit is a great opportunity to connect with 
students, regardless of what college or university they end up 
attending. 
Lo e x-2006    45 -oUr Tr a n s i Ti o n Mi s s i o n : re aCh i n g oU T To Th e hi g h sCh o o L...-Transitioning to College
 As mentioned earlier, high schools often work under strict 
budget considerations that may prohibit them from scheduling student 
visits to a university library. Also, some high schools (particularly in 
rural areas) may not be located near a college or university campus. 
To address these barriers, discussions were held between a small 
group of academic and high school librarians to explore alternative 
modes of delivery. 
 We began by examining a project, Pathways to Academic 
Libraries (P.A.L.) http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/infosrv/lue/
pal/, developed by Colleen Boff, the first-year experience librarian at 
Bowling Green State University in Ohio. P .A.L. uses online instructional 
videos to help students understand more about academic libraries and 
college-level research. Since this seemed like an effective way to share 
information without bringing students to campus, the decision was made 
to update the videos and to make them less specific to Bowling Green 
and more generic to any academic library – in or out of Ohio. During 
these discussions, other tools were also identified as being potentially 
useful to both high school seniors and first year students.
 Additional funding was received through a Library 
Services and Technology Act (LSTA) mini-grant program in 
Spring 2006. The grant allowed for the creation of new videos 
and provided support for the development of a Web site, 
Transitioning to College: Helping Students Succeed  (www.
transitioning2college.or g).  The overall objectives for the 
project were to help students understand the unique features 
of academic libraries and to provide resources that would help 
reduce the anxiety of being a new student on campus. Several 
academic librarians, with input from high school library media 
specialists, collaborated to develop scripts for five videos:• Welcome to Academic Libraries
• Talking to Databases
• Tips for Research Success
• Getting Help When You Need It
• College: What to Expect
 The videos present information from a student’s rather than 
a librarian’s perspective. They feature two first-year students, Emily 
and Jason, who are being mentored by Brian, a college junior. The 
videos, which are mounted on the Transitioning to College Web  site 
and streamed from a Quicktime server, each last from three to five 
minutes. They are set up as modules with supplementary material 
(sample course assignments, syllabi, Web site links, etc.) tied to the 
video theme. For example, the Talking to Databases  module includes 
tips for creating a search strategy, links to worksheets that help students 
identify key concepts, diagrams explaining Boolean connectors, and an 
explanation of the difference between subject and general databases. 
The Transitioning to College Web  site also includes a glossary of 
academic terms and a list of additional web resources that students can 
explore. Several lesson plans provide suggestions for how instructors 
can use the site with students in the classroom. 
 The Web site and videos can be used in several ways: by 
high school librarians and teachers to prepare students for college, by 
academic librarians working with first year students, or by the students 
themselves. In spring 2006, this site was still in development and had 
not yet been used extensively by students. It is hoped that feedback from 
librarians and students will lead to additional enhancements so that this 
Web site becomes a viable alternative for those who cannot visit an 
academic library firsthand.

 As one of its ILILE initiatives, the Libraries at Kent State 
embarked on creating an assessment tool to measure information 
literacy competencies in high school students. This project was 
undertaken with the belief that such an instrument could help 
school library media specialists and high school teachers diagnose 
information literacy strengths and weaknesses within a given 
classroom. 
TRAILS  oB JeC Ti v e s
To be useful and used, TRAILS  had to meet the following 
objectives:
1. Be standards-based :  Given the climate of assessment 
within K-12 education, we realized that TRAILS  would 
have credibility only if it related to existing standards. 
This would give library media specialists confidence 
that TRAILS  addressed core competencies, as well 
as opportunities to connect with teachers who were 
addressing related standards.
2. Available on the Web at no cost :  We wanted to insure that use of TRAILS  was not hindered by cost. Making 
it freely available would encourage use based on local 
needs.
3. Easy to administer :  As a self-service tool, the library 
media specialist could initiate a session on their own 
schedule. For Kent State, self-service eliminated 
significant administration costs.
4. Privacy insured :  No personal student information would 
be collected.
5. Accessibility of reports :  After administering a session, a 
report of outcomes should be immediately available.
iTeM de v e Lo pMe nT
 Two school library media specialists served as consultants 
to develop TRAILS  assessment items.  To insure that TRAILS  
addressed core information literacy competencies, they reviewed 
all 9th grade Ohio Academic Content Standards for areas related 
Lo e x-2006    47 -oUr Tr a n s i Ti o n Mi s s i o n : re aCh i n g oU T To Th e hi g h sCh o o L...-to information literacy as well as the standards and indicators 
laid out in Information Power  for the 9th – 12th grade student 
group. Further analysis resulted in classifying these into twelve 
information literacy categories. Priority competencies were then 
identified within each category.  For each of these, assessment 
objectives were developed and items written to address the 
objectives. These draft items were field tested by volunteer library 
media specialists and 9th grade students to determine if the items 
were understandable and measuring what was intended.                                                                                       
ho w TRAILS  wo rKs
 The library media specialist registers for an account at the 
TRAILS  Web site ( http://www.trails-9.or g).  After signing in and 
going to the “My Account” page, it is possible to create a session 
for a specific class. Two assessments are available for pre-viewing 
prior to selection. Also offered is the choice of getting a report on 
individual students in addition to the class report.  After creating a 
session, it will show as being open and ready to administer to the 
class. The Web URL is provided and, if the individual student report 
option was selected, a list of unique student codes is generated. 
The library media specialist then assigns a code to each student to 
track performance. When all students have completed the session, 
the library media specialist again signs in to her account, goes to 
the “My Account” page, and closes the open session.  A link to a 
report on outcomes appears for both the class as a whole and by 
student code if used.
TRAILS : Th e ne xT sTe p
 TRAILS  went live with full functionality in January 2006. 
In five months the number of registered users grew to over 300.  
More important than numbers has been the initial response.  Here 
is an example of its use in one high school:
I tested the student workers in my Media Center and 
found it simple to use -- both for the students and me…. I 
now have 2 of the 5 freshmen teachers scheduled for their students to take test 1, after which they will go through 
an instructional unit on research, information, and media 
literacy skills before the students begin a research project. 
At the conclusion of the project the students will take test 
2. The statistical information will be a wonderful tool 
when I present the TRAILS  assessment to my principal 
and English department chairperson. 
 We have also received a number of enhancement 
suggestions on how to provide more flexibility in the use of 
TRAILS .  Development will continue on identified priority areas in 
this last year of ILILE support.

Action Points for High School to College Transition Collaborations
□ Identify programs on your campus in which high schools are involved and make a connection with them (e.g., postsecondary 
work, bridge programs like Upward Bound).
□ Reach out to local library media specialists to introduce yourself and show your willingness to consult and collaborate regarding 
college preparation and expectations. 
□ Think about developing a one page handout about your information literacy expectations for new students. This will help 
solidify your thinking and be a great tool for communicating with library media specialists and teachers. 
□ Identify the top five to ten feeder high schools for your institution. Where are your new students coming from? 
□ Investigate the K-12 educational terrain in your state. What role do standards play? Is information literacy included? 
□ Learn about the professional organizations, statewide and regionally, that support library media specialists. They have meetings, 
conferences, committees, and publications, which all present opportunities to connect.  
□ Along these same lines, find out if local school districts offer regular professional development sessions to their teachers and 
librarians. If so, consider offering to speak. 
□ Consider developing a program whereby local high school classes can visit your library . 
□ Consider offering borrowing privileges to local high school students. 
□ Finally, consider your first-year students in light of what you’ve learned about high school to college transitions.

hours of their lives reading, but over 10,000 hours playing video 
games (not to mention 20,000 hours watching TV) . (Prensky, 
2001a, 1)
 Today’s college students are part of the so-called 
Millennials generation, those born between 1982 and 2002, 
who have grown up in a digital environment and are therefore 
considered “digital natives”,  vis-à-vis the rest of us who, as 
“digital immigrants”, have acquired various levels of fluency with 
the digital language of computers, video games and the Internet. 
Being native speakers of this new language, today’s students 
“think and process information  fundamentally differently  from 
their predecessors”, but they are still taught mostly by instructors 
who speak the language of the pre-digital age (Prensky, 2001a). 
These students prefer multitasking and parallel-processing, learn 
by discovery and construction, and prefer to access information 
randomly rather than sequentially; they blend work, play 
and learning all together, and are used to operating in virtual 
communities that provide a sense of connection and are sources 
of information (Prensky, 2001). They are also smart and confident, 
follow the rules and respect authority—including their parents’. 
Their social structure is the group, the team, and they believe in the 
collective power of their generation to change things (Howe and 
Strauss, 2000).
whY a r e MiL Le n n i a Ls iMp o r Ta nT a n d whY do we

 Sheer numbers, for one: 2005 projections show more than 
102 million people in this generation, in comparison with more 
than 82 million of baby boomers (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005, Table 
12). Their impact on higher education is already substantial and 
is bound to grow: by 2014, the number of Millennials attending 
colleges and universities is estimated at more than 16 million, or 
83 percent of all students (National Center for Education Statistics, 2004, Table 173). They are the students we are serving and teaching 
in our academic libraries, and we need to target both our services 
and our teaching to their learning styles and preferences.
 Good teachers have always embraced such a tenet. One 
of the preferred learning styles of the Millennials, learning through 
collaboration with their peers, was the main topic of Kenneth 
Bruffee’s 1984 seminal pedagogical article, “Collaborative Learning 
and the ‘Conversation of Mankind.” Starting from the premise that 
“knowledge is an artifact created by a community of knowledgeable 
peers constituted by the language of that community, and that 
learning is a social and not an individual process”, Bruffee states 
that “To learn is to work collaboratively to establish and maintain 
knowledge among a community of knowledgeable peers through 
the process . . .” (646) of explaining and justifying our beliefs 
to others. To learn the discourse of any knowledge community 
requires a process of negotiation for students, and “collaborative 
learning models how knowledge is generated, how it changes and 
grows” (647).   Video games model this collaborative learning, and 
Millennials are steeped in that culture. Collaborative learning is 
also one of the building blocks of the University Writing Program 
(UWP) curriculum at George Washington University and of the 
UW20 component specifically, which is a mandatory, 4-credit 
course for all freshmen aimed at teaching composition, rhetoric, 
writing, and research. Collaborative learning and peer evaluation 
are practiced by the UWP faculty, as well as by us librarians who 
teach in close partnership with them.
 Teaching in partnership with UW20 faculty has been a 
very enriching and satisfying experience. We have been actively 
studying pedagogical theory to challenge ourselves and our 
assumptions about learning and teaching, and we have been 
applying the theory to our instruction, which has made us adopt 
teaching methods that favor collaboration and student-driven 
instruction. For example, we allow the students to teach each 
other how to use databases and to lead the class.  By designing 
assignments that involve self-discovery and exploration, we 
also strive to encourage and foster critical thinking, which is an 
essential component of the UW20 curriculum. Such a partnership, 
however, is time intensive. The Education & Instruction Group wh aT do e s fi r sT-pe r s o n  sh o o Te r ha v e To do w iTh LiBr a r i e s ?

our face-to-face time with our UW20 students. Ideally we would 
prefer to focus more on the complex research problems and less on 
the building blocks.  In addition, we would like to be able to offer 
more instruction to other populations on campus, beyond our core 
audience of freshmen. These were factors that established the need 
for a form of virtual instruction in support of the UW20 program, 
which would be, however, an integral part of the course and would 
support the same teaching philosophy.

 Having established this generation’s preference for 
learning interactively and cooperatively, by doing and exploring, 
we concluded that even the best examples of information literacy 
online tutorials available were not really addressing these learning 
preferences. Most online tutorials are organized linearly, are 
text heavy, involve very little actual interaction, discovery and 
critical thinking, and include no group activities. We saw a game 
as an extension of the dialogue between pedagogical theory and 
traditional library instructional theory.  “Video games have the 
potential to lead to active and critical learning” thanks to two 
elements: “One is the internal design of the game itself. . . . The 
other is the people around the learner, other players and nonplayers” 
(Gee, 2003, 46). In addition, we had also learned that gaming was a 
very familiar activity for our students and that universities—along 
with government agencies and corporations—had already tapped 
into the potential of gaming technology for teaching and training 
purposes. Therefore, we decided that a game would be an engaging 
learning tool for the students, as well as a fitting teaching platform 
for the goals of the UW20 program. UW20 faculty members 
provided feedback along the way and were intrigued by the idea.
 Our decision to combine library instruction with gaming 
involved the challenge of learning two new discourses: that of 
the gamers community and that of the computer programmers 
with whom we would soon be involved in developing our game. 
Learning the gaming discourse started with us sitting down with a 
library staff member, who would later become our game’s graphic 
designer, and getting an overview of his favorite games, why he 
liked them and what was fun and engaging  about them. Then we 
did a literature review to find out what was happening in the world 
of both serious and entertainment games. Finally we dabbled at 
actually playing a few games. Learning the discourse of computer 
programmers proved itself a double challenge: as we were going 
through the process of forging a collaboration with GWU’s 
Computer Science Department, we needed both to understand the 
language and perspective of the students who were interested in 
participating in the project and make them understand the discourse 
of library instruction and what we were trying to teach.
 Our target population of approximately 2,400 freshmen and 
the UW20’s focus on collaboration made a MMORG’s, or Massively 
Multi-player Role-playing Online Game, the best choice of game type for our purposes. This type of computer game enables hundreds 
or thousands of players to simultaneously interact in a game world 
they are connected to via the Internet, at any given time. The role-
playing aspect comes from the players’ ability to freely develop their 
own characters, with actions as simple as changing their appearance 
on screen, or as complicated as manipulating the statistical attributes 
of the character and, therefore, their performance. This can be done 
through avatars—any graphical representation that a player takes on in 
participating in any game. Our game is a role-playing game because the 
players are playing the role of reporters and originally it was supposed 
to include avatars to help engage our students and offer them some 
creative control and choices within the game. The game also uses the 
First-Person Shooter perspective, where the player is meant to “see 
through the eyes of the character” while interacting with the rest of the 
world (Wikipedia, 2006).
 The decision of focusing on developing only one module 
of our game also came early on: this would allow us to operate 
within a realistic timeframe with the end result of having a product 
to test, show others, and use as a prototype for pursuing funding 
opportunities.  The full-blown game would grow, tree-like, by 
adding modules to a solid underpinning represented by our scenario 
and overall goal, which was to create a game that would engage 
students in discovering the various components of the research 
process and its recursive nature. For our first module, we targeted 
the learning outcome of topic refinement, including finding 
background information on a topic, creating questions about the 
chosen topic, identifying where information can be found on the 
topic, searching for information, and locating sources.
 Brainstorming game scenarios was fun and also very 
hard; in fact, it was the first of many hard tasks. Among several 
ideas, some downright hilarious (beauty pageant, anyone?),   we 
zoomed in on the world of journalism, research being second 
nature to that environment. Our students would be cub reporters 
at three competing magazines, all based in Washington D.C. and 
all with different ideological perspectives. We took this idea, along 
with two other ones, to some of our students to get some feedback, 
and that’s how Muckrakers  was born.
 Next we started creating a storyboard, the old-fashioned 
way with multicolor construction paper pinned to the wall, adding, 
changing, revising and discussing ideas, flow, and educational 
goals. We constantly had to challenge our own concepts and 
perceptions of instruction and learning in light of the new medium 
we were dealing with, of our focus on engaging the students, 
and on the pedagogical goals of promoting critical thinking and 
collaborative work.
 
 Players are assigned to one of the magazines by spinning 
the Wheel of the Future. They meet the editor who tells them about 
the magazine and the work environment and gives them their first 
assignment, which is to come up with a story idea that will be used 
as the feature article of the next issue. Players rank given story 
topics according to their preferences, and are then sorted in teams 
by the game according to their chosen topics. 
Lo e x-2006    51 -w h aT do e s fi r sT-pe r s o n  sh o o Te r ha v e To do w iTh LiBr a r i e s ?- Each individual within a team comes up with one story 
idea, and then the team decides which of the proposed story ideas is the 
best one and will bring that idea to the magazine staff meeting where the 
feature story idea will be chosen. Within this framework, players can 
explore other areas of the game to discover interesting information and 
gain extra points: for example, they can go to the magazine’s library or 
play a card game based on narrowing topics. The game scoring relies 
on peer evaluation, as opposed to right or wrong answers; such a system 
would possibly increase the level of players’ involvement, would not 
require time commitment for evaluation from either the faculty or the 
librarians, and supports what is already happening in UW20 classes. 
Students are involved in the research process in a larger context, they 
can rely on each other for feedback and scoring, and they can play the 
game independently of their level of knowledge.
 Reaching a satisfactory level of clarity as to how the 
game would be played took months, and it would not have 
happened without Chris Granatino, the Reference Department 
Manager of IT at Gelman Library, a dedicated gamer and soon-to-
be graduate student in Library Science at the University of North 
Carolina-Chapel Hill. Conversant with the gamers discourse, he 
provided the inside knowledge of what gamers look for in playing 
games (e.g., incentives) and the know-how about scoring, and 
has served as a bridge between us and our computer programmer 
and our two very different discourses. Our programmer, Juman 
Byun, is a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Sciences at GWU 
with a strong interest in developing educational games. He has 
participated and supported this project from the very beginning 
and has single-handedly developed the technical side of the game 
as it exists now.
 The learning curve was very steep for all of us, and the 
challenges were many. Time and money, or lack thereof, determined 
much of what we could and could not do. We started with no budget, 
which slowed down the project considerably. Eventually, we received 
$13,000 from the library administration to pay both our programmer 
and graphic artist. Considering that “A typical . . . computer game costs 
from $1 million up to $15 million to develop, . . . can take from one to 
three years to develop, . . . and development teams number anywhere 
from 20 to 50 people” (Wikipedia 2006), we are still amazed at what 
we have been able to accomplish, with limited time available, with 
three librarians, one gamer, one computer programmer and a part-time 
graphic designer. We had to sacrifice some items on our wish list: this 
module has no avatars; our original testing date had to be postponed 
because of delays in programming and in getting the needed server 
up and running; we have no music score; and we had to hold back on 
some creative ideas because of the time involved in developing them.  
   In an ideal world, we would have liked to have more 
programmers and technical staff; we would have spent more time 
immersing ourselves in playing games; we would have taken time off 
from other duties and work just on the game for at least two months; 
and we would have established a more systematic collaboration with 
UW20 faculty throughout the entire process. We are still planning 
on testing this iteration of the game with at least 60 UW20 students 
to assess students’ level of engagement. We will also pursue grant 
opportunities to build additional modules and incorporate the many 
ideas that have occurred to us, with the help of additional librarians. 
Muckrakers  has already generated much interest, and we are looking 
forward to feedback and ideas for collaboration.

is crucial to the success of any library instruction program, yet 
reaching all faculty can be more difficult than initially anticipated.  
Increasingly larger numbers of college teachers are either non-
tenure-track or graduate teaching assistants.  Unfortunately, these 
groups can be notoriously difficult to reach since they often act like 
“moving targets.” Graduate teaching assistants usually move on to 
other institutions or employment, and non-tenure-track positions 
are indefinite. How do we reach transient teachers who often teach 
in less than ideal circumstances? Who are they, what do they want 
from library instruction, and how can we meet their needs in ways 
that ultimately will best serve students? To address these questions, 
we have reviewed literature on higher education employment and 
library outreach to teaching faculty. We also conducted an online 
survey of teachers responsible for rhetoric courses at the University 
of Illinois at Urbana – Champaign (UIUC). This paper presents 
results from this research and offers strategies for communicating 
with these often transient—but still vital—teachers.
wh o a r e Th e Te aCh e r s ?
 More than 630,000 full-time faculty were employed in the 
United States in fall 2003, according to Integrated Postsecondary 
Education Data System (IPEDS) data collected from more than 
6,500 postsecondary institutions by the National Center for 
Education Statistics. Of these faculty, 35% are non-tenure-track. 
More than 888,656 faculty have primarily instructional duties;  
381,609 are full-time and 480,914 are part-time. Add the almost 
294,000 graduate assistants employed in fall 2003, and we see 
a significant number of non-permanent employees involved in 
postsecondary teaching (Knapp et al., 2005, pp. 9-12).
  Non-tenure-track teaching faculty can go by many names: 
adjuncts, instructors, lecturers, visiting, contingent faculty, teaching 
associates. Their primary role is to teach courses, rather than to 
conduct research or administrative duties. Teaching loads vary 
from school to school and can be as much as five or six courses a 
semester. According to the 2004 National Survey of Postsecondary 
Faculty  (NSOPF), an NCES survey that occurs every five years, 
full-time instructional staff in humanities fields work an average 
of 52.9 hours a week; “part-time” instructors average 38.4 hours a 
week (Cataldi, et al., 2005, p. 28). Their positions can be tenuous, 
as their contracts are often on an academic year or semester-to-
semester basis. Part-time instructors often teach on more than one 
campus in order to approach a full-time income. At times hired 
only weeks or days before a term, they can receive little or no 
orientation to campus resources.  They may teach similar courses 
at each institution, utilizing the same syllabus and assignments, 
unaware of the varied library resources available at each.  Many 
are practicing professionals called upon by smaller institutions to 
teach one course per semester.  They may rarely be on campus 
beyond the teaching time for the course. Shared or no office and 
computer access can make them difficult to reach by phone or 
campus e-mail.
 Graduate students who teach also can have several 
names: teaching assistants or TAs, graduate instructors, graduate 
assistants. They generally teach 1-2 courses a semester, with 
duties ranging from grading to leading discussions to full 
responsibility for planning and teaching courses. They often 
have no training in teaching, other than a week or less of 
orientation that seldom introduces them to the library resources 
that their students will need to access. Many TAs are responsible 
for subjects in which they have little background; for instance, 
graduate students studying literature usually teach first-year 
composition. Often new to campus, TAs can be unfamiliar with 
library resources outside of their immediate specialty and might 
send freshman rhetoric students to inappropriate specialized 
sources (Forys, 1999, p. 232).Ze r o i n g  i n o n a Mo v i n g  Ta r g e T: sTr aTe g i e s  f o r re aCh i n g

 54    L o e x-2006   -sUs a n av e r Y a n d eMiL Y ro g e r s - All of these teachers are very busy, dividing their energy and 
time among competing priorities. They often are taking two or more 
classes, studying for qualifying exams, writing dissertations, and/or 
applying for jobs. Yet in many institutions they are primary points of 
contact for new students on campus.  The Association of Departments 
of English noted in its Report of the ADE Ad Hoc Committee on 
Staffing  (1999) that “… adjuncts and TAs normally teach the most 
contact-intensive courses, such as first-year writing or lower-level 
literature courses, where they encounter large numbers of freshmen 
and sophomores” (p. 21).  These same instructors often have little 
knowledge of the library and its resources.
 Most undergraduate campuses in the United States have first-
year composition courses that serve as many students’ first encounters 
with academic libraries and research at the college level.  At UIUC 
during 2004-2005, for instance, TAs taught 63.1% of these first-year 
courses, with  21.4% taught by “other”: non-tenure-track faculty 
(Division of Management Information, 2006).  Nationally, a 1999 
Modern Language Association survey indicated that graduate assistants 
and non-tenure-track faculty taught 94% of first-year writing courses 
in programs granting doctoral degrees and 80% of these courses in 
MA-granting programs (Laurence, 2001, p. 216). Because TAs and 
non-tenure-track faculty offer so many of the courses that require 
students to develop information literacy skills, academic librarians 
have a chance to build relationships that can significantly impact 
undergraduate education.
faC U L T Y  a n d sT Ud e n Ts: ex p e C TaTi o n s a n d re aLiTi e s
 For instruction librarians, transient teachers present both an 
opportunity and a challenge. By acquainting these teachers with what 
our libraries and information literacy programs have to offer, we can 
help them understand their students’ needs more effectively, prepare 
assignments better suited to our resources, and even make their jobs 
easier. A March 2006 Chronicle of Higher Education  article reports that 
84% of surveyed faculty feel students are unprepared or only somewhat 
prepared for college (Sanoff, p. B9). While 91% of faculty encourage 
students to use computers “very much or quite a bit” in their work, 73% 
emphasize making judgments on the value of information “very much or 
quite a bit” ( Liberal Education Outcomes,  2005. sec. 3).
 Teachers and librarians recognize these needs; however, 
undergraduates often do not. The Pew Internet and American Life 
Project  reports that 86% of incoming students have gone online, 
and 73% use the Internet more than the library (Jones, 2002, p. 2-3). 
Their judgment about the quality of sources falls short, for 80% use 
search engines for most assignments, two-thirds say they know best 
what Internet information is acceptable, and 20% find no difference 
in quality between sites with commercial advertising and those 
without ( OCLC White Paper , 2002, p. 4).  A Wellesley study found 
that fewer than 2% of students consider non-Internet sources yet feel 
very confident in their abilities to find information; “overwhelmingly 
susceptible” to advertising and misinformation, they consider finding 
information more important than evaluating information (Graham & 
Metaxes, 2003, p. 72). Where are the librarians when students start to research? 
The 2002 OCLC White Paper reports that when students need 
help finding information on the Web, 60% go to friends, 33% 
go to professors or TAs, and only 20% go to librarians (p. 5).   
Although it might be desirable to present arguments to faculty 
about the benefits of library instruction, concrete proof that library 
instruction will improve the quality of their students’ research is 
elusive.  However, a 2002-2003 survey asking journalism and 
mass communications faculty about the impact of information 
literacy programs provided some promising evidence: 55.2% 
indicated students’ research processes improved (Singh, 2005, p. 
300). A University of New Mexico study that compared student 
research papers before and after the introduction of an inquiry-
based instruction program noted little difference.  Small trends in 
the improvement of student research choices were encouraging, 
as was increased collaboration between librarians and faculty 
(Emmons & Martin, 2002, p. 560). Discussions with librarians and 
faculty will provide anecdotal evidence of the connection between 
library instruction and the quality of student research.
sUr v e Yi n g Tr a n s i e n T Te aCh e r s  aT UiUC
 At UIUC, we wondered what the people teaching 
Composition I classes—mostly non-tenure-track faculty and TAs—
expected from their students and from library instruction. Our 
online survey went to 89 teachers via two departmental listservs 
in November and early December 2005.  A portion of this survey 
focused on teachers’ expectations about students’ preparation for 
conducting research, their experiences with Undergraduate Library 
instruction, and the best ways to communicate information about 
library instructional services.
 We received 32 responses, for a response rate of 36%. 
Respondents included Master’s level TAs (25%); PhD-level TAs 
(53%); and adjunct instructors or lecturers (22%). Their teaching 
experience varied from 2 years or less (41%); 3 to 4 years (31%); 
and 5 years or more (31%).  Overall, they believe incoming students 
have little previous experience with academic research tasks.  
Most felt that fewer than half of their students have background 
finding books in online catalogs; 91% of respondents believed that 
25% or fewer students come to college with experience searching 
article databases; 78% believed that 25% or fewer students can 
distinguish scholarly and popular periodicals. Yet most of their 
students must perform these tasks by the end of the semester. All 
respondents expect students to locate articles, 91% expect their 
students to locate books, and 72% expect students to locate Web 
pages on their topics. Clearly an instruction program focusing on 
information literacy skills is vitally important to student success.

 In many ways building positive relationships with our 
target groups differs little from working with full-time tenure-track 
faculty.  Librarians generally work much more collaboratively than 
do many faculty, and it serves us well to become acquainted with 
Lo e x-2006    55 -Ze r o i n g  i n o n a Mo v i n g  Ta r g e T:...-what Larry Hardesty calls the “prevalent canons of faculty culture” 
(1995). Among the most important is professional autonomy, which 
can be partially responsible for a faculty member’s unwillingness 
to share classroom time and resistance to change.  In many settings 
faculty do not view librarians as equals, even when faculty status 
of librarians is the norm.  A faculty member’s actual or perceived 
lack of time may also contribute to an unwillingness to share class 
time with someone from the outside, as can a sense of insecurity. 
These canons, along with the less than ideal working situations 
of our target groups, provide further perspective in understanding 
transient teachers.
 Additionally, laying the foundation for good faculty/
librarian relationships with full-time faculty plays an important 
role in building positive relationships with transient teachers, as 
faculty support of library instruction can be passed along to others, 
including their own students who teach.  Further strategies include 
establishing strategic partnerships with program directors, chairs, or 
respected faculty within a department.  Official liaison relationships 
between individual librarians and academic departments can 
provide the opportunity to attend departmental faculty meetings 
and open the lines of communication.  Being aware of campus 
initiatives and the library’s role in their development assures both 
library presence and exposure.   Formal introductions to the library 
for new faculty and review sessions on library resources for all 
faculty increase both library awareness and visibility.   Reaching 
part-time faculty can hinge on the relationships established with 
full-time faculty and administrators, who can provide guidance.
 Reaching TAs often requires additional techniques, as they 
might not have access to the same campus opportunities afforded 
faculty.  Establishing relationships with departmental and program 
coordinators is the most expedient means of reaching this population.  
Most institutions that employ TAs will provide training sessions 
before fall semester begins.  Both TAs and program coordinators 
often welcome librarians to these sessions.  Assigning specific 
librarians to serve as liaisons to individual teaching assistants can 
promote instruction, individual consultations, assignment reviews, 
and other library offerings.  Workshops of interest to TAs can be 
offered as professional development seminars.  Given the generally 
shorter time span of many TAs’ affiliation with a department, 
relationships with supervising faculty and program directors are 
especially crucial for working with this population.
 When provided the opportunity to do so through our 
survey, the UIUC teachers offered several suggestions for reaching 
them.  These respondents indicated e-mail messages are the most 
effective. E-mail addressed personally to teachers might get more 
attention than listserv messages: 78% rate personally addressed 
messages as either highly or extremely effective, but 72% rank 
listserv messages at least as effective. Almost half rated flyers/
notices received through campus mail as somewhat effective. 
Almost no respondents found announcements on the library’s 
Web site or flyers posted in the English department particularly 
effective.  In many cases, it was persistent e-mail communication 
on the part of the library that made the difference.Co nC L U s i o n
 Although building relationships with adjunct and part-
time faculty and graduate teaching assistants can be challenging, 
these teachers are certainly worth pursuing.  The contact hours they 
have with freshmen in particular justify additional efforts to reach 
out to this constituency.  The methods for reaching these transient 
teachers may require added persistence on the part of librarians, 
but the advantages provided to our students dictate doggedness 
on our part.  Moments of frustration are certain to occur, but our 
outreach to all teachers, transient or otherwise, will serve to benefit 
all at our institutions.

 Experimentation with virtual reference at Boatwright 
Memorial Library (main library at the University of Richmond) 
began in 2000.  The University Libraries are part of the larger 
Information Services Division, including the Computing Help 
Desk.  Help Desk colleagues were interested in exploring 
interactive virtual software to answer computing questions, so in 
early 2000 both librarians and computer specialists attended an 
on-campus demonstration of “Dr. Bean On Call”, an interactive 
software program developed by Sideware Systems, Inc.  The Dr. 
Bean software was intriguing and staff moved forward with testing 
it in both the Help Desk and Reference Service environments.  
Its biggest drawback was that it was sold by individual “seats”, 
meaning that it was not a shared, web-based product and therefore 
it could not be accessed easily from each librarian’s computer. Due 
to costs, it was installed on only one computer in the Reference 
office and this proved to be a hindrance with training and regular 
use by the librarians.  Limited advertising was distributed on 
campus and through the library’s website, but librarians received 
very few virtual questions.  In 2001, the Sideware company went 
bankrupt and Dr. Bean was no longer supported.  Although this first 
experiment was not successful in terms of reaching large numbers 
of users, it was a good opportunity for librarians to test and learn 
more about the new technology.
 By the summer of 2001, there were several virtual software 
developments underway, particularly for libraries.  Boatwright 
reference librarians attended a Virtual Reference Seminar at the 
Library of Congress in spring 2001.  During this seminar, the 
Collaborative Digital Reference Service (CDRS) project, a new 
endeavor sponsored by the Library of Congress and OCLC was 
introduced.  As a result of attending the conference, the library decided to participate in the new pilot project for several months.  
Eventually CDRS turned into OCLC’s Questionpoint (virtual 
reference service), but at the time, both staff and administrators 
thought the relatively high cost of Questionpoint would not equal 
the use.  Another option was 24/7 Reference, a round-the-clock 
reference cooperative and service developed by the Metropolitan 
Cooperative Library System in Southern California. There were 
many appealing features on 24/7 Reference, including the ability 
to co-browse and push pages to users, but there were also several 
difficult technical issues with the software, primarily around 
firewall issues at the university. Another option was InstantService, 
a web-based chat service headquartered in Seattle, Washington. 
The fact that InstantService was web-based and not sold by “seats” 
was very appealing.  Another excellent selling point was that at 
that time, InstantService was offering no-cost access to nonprofit 
institutions.  
 During 2002-2004, InstantService was used on a regular 
basis by librarians.  It is a very user-friendly system and offers 
features such as the ability to push pages to users, create pre-scripted 
responses, transfer questions to another librarian, and record 
transcripts of chat sessions.  Librarians were reluctant to integrate 
InstantService at the reference desk, so a “virtual reference” 
schedule was created so that librarians could answer InstantService 
messages at their desk.  However, after two semesters, statistics 
remained low.  Reference staff then experimented with expanded 
evening hours by employing student assistants to serve as the first 
contact for questions and then transfer them to the reference desk if 
further assistance was needed. Although the idea of using student 
assistants was a good one, in reality it presented several problems, 
primarily the provision of consistent training and supervision for 
the student assistants.  In addition, usage continued to remain low 
and the student assistants were bored with the work. 
 Librarians were discouraged with the low response 
of questions and wrestled with the issues of providing time and 
training for the service, with the return of very little use.  Although Co n n e C Ti n g w iTh aiM: T h e se a r Ch f o r a vi rT UaL

for student use, in that they had to go to the library’s website, 
click on the InstantService icon, complete the online form with 
name and user information and then connect to the librarian.  The 
search for a more appealing library virtual reference software 
continued.  Although none of the reference staff were using it, 
instant messaging, particularly AOL’s Instant Messenger (AIM), 
was growing in popularity.  Would libraries turn to this technology 
as a way to reach users?

 After hearing that the University North Carolina – Chapel 
Hill (UNC-CH) had been experimenting with AIM and had good 
response from students, the reference staff at Boatwright Library 
decided to try it. In comparison with previous experiments in 
virtual reference, the processes of acquisition, setup, staffing, and 
training for AIM were remarkably simple. The software itself is 
free and easy to download. The reference staff decided to handle 
AIM at the reference desk, so no additional staffing was required. 
AIM also requires very little specialized training. The reference 
staff practiced using AIM to communicate with one another 
before launching the virtual reference service. It turned out to be 
a convenient tool, which the staff has continued to use regularly. 
Those who had experience using AIM also provided informal 
training sessions, and the reference staff agreed on some informal 
guidelines for this new form of reference provision. The buddy 
name chosen was “boatwrightinfo” and the service was launched in 
late November 2004. The buddy name and service were advertised 
through small stickers on all the library computers and through 
Spiderbytes , the university’s daily online announcement newsletter. 
In the first three months of service, 117 questions were answered 
via IM.  This number surpassed all of the librarians’ expectations 
and any previous attempts with other virtual reference services.  
 Since its initial implementation, use of the AIM reference 
service has remained strong. During the spring 2005 semester, 189 
IM questions were received. In fall 2005, the number rose to 298. 
Traffic at the physical reference desk is relatively high, in part 
because the University of Richmond has a small student body, 95 
percent of whom reside on campus for their entire undergraduate 
education. When compared to the total reference questions 
received, IM composed 6 percent in spring 2005 and 9 percent 
in fall 2005. In comparison, e-mail questions comprised only 4.5 
percent of total reference questions in spring 2005 and 3 percent in 
fall 2005. 
 Staffing AIM at the reference desk has worked well in 
our particular environment. A single reference staff member is 
available at the integrated main service desk from 8:00 a.m. to 
10:00 p.m. Monday-Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Friday, 
1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Saturday, and 1:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on 
Sunday. He or she staffs AIM, telephone reference, and face-to-
face service simultaneously. Speakers attached to the computer are turned on at low volume so that when a new IM request is received, 
the librarian is alerted both by sound (chime) and sight (popup 
window). Face to face and telephone queries take precedence 
over IM questions, but AIM patrons have proven to be patient in 
waiting when necessary. This may be because they are accustomed 
to using AIM while simultaneously engaging in other activities. 
Reference staff do try to acknowledge incoming chats and let them 
know when a wait is expected. 
 Prior to beginning the service, the reference staff agreed 
that a level of professionalism should be maintained even though 
the medium is informal. While basic customer service practices 
of politeness and attentiveness are employed by all, each staff 
member also has a unique IM style. Friendliness and humor are 
particularly effective in establishing a rapport with the patron. The 
use of AIM between library staff members has been important in 
raising their comfort level with instant messaging, and has also 
proven to be an effective method of interoffice communication. 
The customizable “away message” and “buddy info” features are 
particularly useful.
whY h a s aoL i n sTa nT Me s s e n g e r  wo rKe d?
 There are a number of interesting issues to consider in 
determining why AIM has been successful when prior attempts 
were not. In terms of acquisition, setup, training, and staffing, 
AIM has certainly been simpler than many other chat software 
offerings. First of all, the software itself is free. And because 
the decision was made to handle AIM at the reference desk, no 
additional staffing was required.  Second, it can be quickly and 
easily downloaded and installed on all staff computers. Before 
implementing it as a virtual reference service, the reference staff 
was encouraged to begin using AIM with one another as a tool 
for interoffice communication. AIM is also convenient from 
the patron’s perspective. If the patron is not using AIM already, 
then he or she must download it from the AOL Web site and add 
boatwrightinfo  as a “buddy.”  This process is fairly intuitive, and 
requires little or no instruction for most users. Following the initial 
download and account setup, the patron can ask questions anytime 
simply by opening AIM and selecting the boatwrightinfo  buddy. 
Unlike some Web-based chat software, there is no need to navigate 
to a specific Web site or fill out a form. 
 At Boatwright Library, it seems that the convenience and 
familiarity of AIM is more important than the various “bells and 
whistles” offered by some of the other virtual reference technologies. 
Many users are already using AIM frequently and have it installed on 
their computers. They use the library reference service just as they use 
IM recreationally – as a multitasking communication tool. When they 
have a point of need question, they want quick, convenient answers. 
The necessity of recalling a particular URL, filling out a form, and 
potentially waiting in a queue or having to remain in a chat window 
interrupts the flow of their work. Similarly, they do not appear to miss 
features such as co-browsing or page pushing. Furthermore, patrons 
generally do not become impatient waiting for answers because they 
can continue their work in the meantime. 
Lo e x-2006    65 -Co n n e C Ti n g w iTh aiM:...- The features of AIM combined with the flow of activity 
at the Boatwright Library main service desk make it possible to 
staff AIM, telephone reference and face to face reference service 
simultaneously. When a staff member logs in to the reference 
computer, he or she is automatically signed on to the boatwrightinfo  
AIM account. Speakers attached to the computer are turned on (low 
volume), so that when a new IM request is received, the librarian 
is alerted both by sound (chime) and sight (popup window). Face 
to face and telephone reference queries take precedence, and IM 
patrons have proven to be very patient in waiting when necessary. 
This is most likely because they are accustomed to keeping their 
AIM window open while working on other activities. Questions 
are not archived automatically, so it does require a conscious 
effort. Boatwright Library staff must remember to save each IM 
session after it has been completed. 
Us e fU Ln e s s o f arCh i v i n g  QUe sTi o n s
 One of the benefits of chat or instant messaging reference 
is the creation of a transcript of the reference transaction. These 
documented questions and responses are enormously helpful 
in making reference service improvements. One use for these 
transcripts at Boatwright Library is training. Past IM sessions 
have been printed and organized in a binder by general topic. New 
hires read through the questions to find out the types of questions 
commonly asked as well as the answers to those questions. Another 
use is to clarify library policies and responses. It is helpful for 
librarians and supervisors to browse chat transcripts in order to 
identify areas where there may be confusion or incongruities in 
the reference staff’s responses. These are topics that may need 
additional attention or training. Because AIM does not provide 
identification of the individual librarian providing the response, 
transcripts are saved anonymously, thus avoiding accusation or 
negative criticism directed toward a particular individual. Finally, 
transcripts are used to identify and respond to patron needs on a 
larger scale. For instance, 26 percent of reference questions (17 
percent of the total volume of questions) received on AIM between 
January and April 2005 related to citing sources. Reference 
librarians responded to this need by purchasing a subscription 
to NoodleBib, a web-based citation builder that guides students 
through the process of creating an MLA or APA citation.
wh aT’s ne xT?
 Although AIM was only implemented at Boatwright 
Library eighteen months ago, new products have already emerged 
that could improve our service. This summer the reference staff 
plans to explore the use of a free or low-cost multi-network IM 
client, such as Trillian or Meebo. These IM aggregators allow 
librarians to accept messages from a variety of IM services (e.g. 
AIM, MSN, Yahoo, etc.), which would be more convenient for 
users who prefer an alternative to AIM. Boatwright Library recently 
formed a “Technology Team” committee that has been exploring, 
among other things, library services for handheld mobile devices. 
With their help, the reference staff will test reference provision via SMS, or short message service, during the summer of 2006. 
If all goes smoothly, it will be implemented in fall 2006, allowing 
users to send reference queries using mobile phones and to receive 
responses in the form of text messages.

1.  Experiment! 
Don’t be afraid to test new products and staffing models to find the 
best fit for your library.
2.  Practice among staff 
Use AIM (or the appropriate IM client) to communicate with one 
another before offering the service to your users. It will increase 
your level of comfort, and you may find it to be a helpful tool in 
the office.
3.  Utilize knowledgeable staff
Find out which staff members have experience with AIM (or the 
appropriate IM client). Ask if they are willing to provide training. 
Don’t forget about student assistants!
4. Integrate into existing services  
How can instant messaging complement other forms of reference 
service, such as telephone, e-mail and in-person assistance?
5.  Market your service creatively
Your users can’t take advantage of the service if they don’t know 
about it! 
6.  Save your transcripts
These can be useful in a number of ways, including training, 
service evaluation/improvement, and data collection.
7.  Personalize
Allow each librarian to communicate in the style most comfortable 
for him or her, while still maintaining a sense of professionalism. 
Watch out for robotic-sounding scripts. Users need to know that 
they are communicating with a live human being. 
8.  Evaluate
After its implementation, be sure to evaluate your IM service 
among both staff and users periodically. Even if it is successful, it 
is important to consider ways to increase effectiveness.
9.  Respond quickly and often
Since the user can’t see you, it is important to monitor your IM 
service closely, and to respond to new requests promptly. When 
responding to a query, check in often to update the user on your 
progress.
10.  Stay current
Pay attention to news and developments relating to instant 
messaging, particularly the service you are using. Alter your 
service as necessary to respond to user wants and expectations.

 Emerging technologies are impacting society at a 
phenomenal rate and it is almost impossible to maintain awareness 
of all the latest up-and-coming technologies. Not all emerging 
technologies are relevant to institutions of higher education or 
academic libraries; but based on students’ expectations about 
technology, new modes of storing, disseminating and accessing 
information, and the development of new learning styles, it is 
imperative that alternative ways of presenting and accessing 
information be provided.
 One area that is greatly being shaped by new technologies 
is library instruction. Information Services at the University 
of Kansas is an integration of three divisions: Networking and 
Telecommunication Services, Information Technology, and 
Libraries. Recently, Information Services combined the “technology 
trainers” and instruction librarians to create an Instructional 
Services unit. This unit has a variety of responsibilities including 
taking the lead in delivering and teaching information and 
technology skills to members of the KU community, which spans 
five campuses across the state of Kansas.  Recently, members of 
the Instructional Services unit perceived a gap between possible 
technology needs and the eventual adoption and diffusion of 
appropriate solutions.  This paper will discuss various questions 
and answers that arose during and around discussions with 
members of Information Services about creating and implementing 
an Emerging Technologies Working Group to fill that gap.
Th e adMi n i s Tr aTi v e go ah e a d
 Before an Emerging Technologies Working Group can 
be created, you most certainly will need to get administrative endorsement. “Emerging Technologies” is a loaded term for many 
administrators and has a wide variety of political implications. 
Just a few of these implications include the higher level of risk 
associated with new technologies, roles and responsibilities, 
funding sources, staffing considerations, infrastructure settings, 
support, maintenance and preservation issues. Therefore, it is 
extremely important that all possible key stakeholders are identified, 
contacted and included. When first approaching your administration 
regarding the convening of an Emerging Technologies Working 
Group, be prepared for the possibility of resistance. Many people 
have varying definitions of emerging technologies and hence 
conflicting approaches to the creation, implementation and ultimate 
accountability of such a group. Organize ahead of time and have 
ready a rationale behind why this type of a group is important and 
beneficial to the library and its users. A rationale might include 
focusing emerging technologies on emerging services (B. Warner, 
Personal Communication, April 6 2006.) These would be core 
services which would enable the Instructional Services unit to aid 
and instruct more library/technology users. It is also imperative 
that you are very clear that the group intends to focus on user 
needs and enhancements, rather than on testing and implementing 
all of the latest fads and gadgets that students, staff and faculty are 
using. 
 There may be other areas of concern that should be 
discussed as well. Can the administration envision how this 
working group would complement broader campus learning 
service goals and how will this group differ from larger campus 
wide IT emerging technology projects? How might some of the 
projects an Instructional Services ET Working Group implements 
also impact campus IT and other units?  An example of this could 
be the use of audio- visual tutorials on local bandwidth. Before 
the working group would be able to move forward, there must 
be administrative backing and the willingness to negotiate and 
collaborate with other units as needed; however, the emphasis 
and goal remains to aid library users in specific ways.  Lastly, get 
your administration to create or endorse a charge for the working Co n v e n i n g  a n eMe r g i n g  TeCh n o Lo g i e s  wo rKi n g gr oUp i n a n

Emerging Technologies Working Group to be successful in testing, 
recommending and implementing emerging services, there must 
be full administrative support.  Otherwise, the working group will 
not be taken seriously and any attempt to implement an emerging 
service might well become an exercise in frustration and futility.
Co n v e n i n g  Th e wo rKi n g gr oUp
 After you have received the administrative ‘green 
light’ there are several issues to contemplate regarding group 
composition.   First, think about the size of your library and, 
perhaps more importantly, the number of potentially interested 
staff.  Whether you have a small or large library, there are issues 
to bear in mind.  If you are a member of a small library, it could 
be relatively easy to put a group together quickly and become 
effective with relative ease.  
 However, on the flip side, it may be difficult to find 
enough interested and qualified staff to form an effective group.  
If you are a member of a large library, it could also be potentially 
simple to find an effectual and manageable group.  On the flip side 
of this, however, you may have too many interested and qualified 
individuals.  It will be incumbent upon you to determine, based on 
staff interest and availability, what size of a group will be effective 
for your purposes.
 Second, ponder what kind of core group will best anchor 
the team.  Will a select group of experts be needed?  Having a 
‘go-to’ list of potential testers and IT pros can lighten the load of 
the team and can provide insight that may be otherwise missed.  
Also, consider composing a varied core group with the possibility 
of forming sub or splinter groups based on the technology being 
reviewed and staff expertise.  
 How members of the core group are selected should 
be established by the Instructional Services unit and the 
administration.  It may be necessary to balance the group with 
appointments and volunteers. Consider the type of skill sets 
needed by a core team.  Experts and other techno-savvy staff will 
be important to the conversation, but neophytes and novices should 
not be overlooked.  Technology amateurs can bring a unique and 
significant perspective to an emerging technologies group.  They 
will often see things from a user perspective or see implications 
that experts and techie veterans no longer notice or otherwise 
neglect.  And there is always the possibility of having a rotating 
membership to keep ideas fresh and avoid techno-burnout.  In any 
case, it is a good idea to give anyone interested the opportunity to 
participate and contribute to the team in some way.  
 Once the group is selected, be clear about the goals and 
objectives of the group to all of the stakeholders.  An emerging 
technologies group should strive for transparency and avoid 
“clique-type” behavior.  Other staff and stakeholders should 
identify the group as an open, supportive and fun assemblage – 
one that will accept any idea and will work to facilitate solutions 
for service.  re s e a r Ch MeTh o d s
 Keeping abreast of emerging technologies will require a 
multifaceted approach and a certain level of “esprit de corps” on 
the part of your team.  While many tools are available to assist in 
maintaining a knowledge base, understanding your team composition 
and aligning it with viable research methods and casual curiosity will 
make the most optimal use of the team members’ time.  While no one 
individual or small team can possibly keep up with non-adopted or 
emergent technologies, it is possible to devise a strategy to keep your 
group in the know, on a need to know basis.
 Consider a two pronged approach to your research methodology. 
These two approaches are based on the ways in which team members 
and other available human resources conduct research. One approach 
is out of personal or professional interest while the other is out of a user 
need-based request. Some members of your core emerging technologies 
group must have a thorough understanding of the information technology 
professionals in your organization. Make lists of those possibly helpful 
IT people and what their individual areas of expertise are. This will 
prevent group members from spending time unearthing technology 
information that is uninteresting or indigestible to them. In essence these 
people are a “ready reference” pool should a question come up in their 
area. They may also be asked to serve on a specific project or in a splinter 
group capacity.  Specific user needs will take group members deeper into 
the research process. Be prepared to research Information/Instructional 
Technology materials for solution  technologies and Library Science 
material for other available institutional experiences and outcomes with 
like-type problem sets. 
 Tools for assisting your group in keeping abreast or 
delving deeper into emerging technologies instructional solutions 
come from a variety of both traditional and new Library Science 
print sources. Instructional Technology scholarly journals also 
address the issues surrounding technology and epistemology. 
Additionally, there are Web resources devoted to the use of emergent 
technologies in learning environments as well as conferences and 
seminars. Lastly, in your research tool bag, do not forget the value 
of play and fun because often that is where students initially set 
the agenda. Reference librarians provide chat service because our 
constituencies rely heavily on chat modes and utilities. Do not be 
afraid to be creative. If there are staff who want to play or learn 
about something they have an interest in, encourage that type of 
exploration, albeit within reasonable time considerations. 
Te sTi n g a n d di sC Us s i o n
 What determines an emergent technology action plan will 
in best practice be driven by user or staff needs. While the focus of 
the team may be on instructional technologies that directly impact 
learning, consider that collaborative tools and communication methods 
to support learning and services are part of the academic mission. Not 
only will direct requests for assistance need to be triaged, team members 
should also be alert to need articulations coming to them in an informal 
way. For example, careful listening to colleagues’ complaints about a 
repetitive or cumbersome task process may become the catalyst for a 
team consultation around that particular user need. 
Lo e x-2006    69 -Co n v e n i n g  a n eMe r g i n g  TeCh n o Lo g i e s  wo rKi n g gr oUp...- Initial concept considerations and discussions may be 
standardized for fairness, efficiency and to meet administrative 
oversights.  Standardized processes may also eliminate the need to 
request approvals at various points along the testing and discussion 
phase.  As the group receives project requests initial concerns such 
as priority, appropriateness and security should weigh heavily.  Early 
initial project consultation with campus security staff will save much 
time and energy. For example, if Perl scripts or CGI is banned on your 
campus, there is no need to even consider applications that utilize these 
means as necessities. 
 Not surprisingly, proof positive, successful new technology 
implementations have most often been accomplished through the testing 
modes that most closely model successful learning methods, namely 
“applied learning.”  Once a need and an appropriate technology pairing 
have been identified, try having an expert splinter group run it on a 
small test project with real user expectations and measurable results. A 
very successful emerging technologies working group, “DataWorks” 
at the University of Nevada, Reno Libraries, actually evolved into a 
library department by identifying specific “need” projects and creating 
or deploying solutions that focused entirely on Web accessible library 
learning services, data interpretation and storage, and collection access 
enhancements (Aldrich & Stefanelli, 2006.)
iMpLeMe nTaTi o n
 The ultimate goal of the team’s endeavors thus far is to get 
the new technology solutions that have been researched and tested 
diffused, implemented and adopted throughout the organization. 
When a winning solution appears to have been found, it is time to 
present findings to the administration for approval and funding.  
How the team chooses to approach this step will be critical to the 
success of the project.
 There will be many considerations surrounding how 
group determinations and findings will be reported and presented.  
In most cases, the team will want to also report on projects that 
have not worked or were abandoned for whatever reasons. Rote 
accountability regarding all investigations should be written 
into the workflow and carried through. Diffusion of that type 
of information throughout the organization via a newsletter or 
website will go a long way toward building organizational trust for 
the team around a process that will most certainly seem mysterious 
to many. 
 Successful projects should be presented to your administration 
in such a way that its efficacy is clear and proven.  Establish the need and 
cover all of the bases.  Be sure to offer full disclosure in areas important 
to managers such as costs, learning curves, timelines and marketing 
strategies.  If possible, show how the solution under consideration has 
been utilized at other institutions. Try to get the administration to think outside the library walls and into the user environment (Nelson, 2005) 
as this is key to any service vision.  Be honest about caveats and how 
they might be addressed. Administrators will certainly come back to the 
group with complaints if pertinent information was not reported which 
later causes problems or financial loss to the organization. Scenarios 
like this will lead to skepticism, apathy and possibly the dissolution of 
the group.
 Likewise, to know when a project may be derailing is of 
critical importance to the success of that and all other upcoming projects. 
If a seemingly workable solution is being held up, as a group, have 
the fortitude to find out why. Obviously, organizations and institutions 
are also political environments that may harbor seemingly innocuous 
agendas which are actually poisonous barriers to service. The team’s 
willingness to confront these issues as a group is simply part of a long 
history of pioneer service to education.  Disarm naysayers by being 
thorough, competent, honest and accountable in the workflow and 
presentation. Build on success by garnishing the support of users and 
colleagues who have benefited form the group’s team work in the past. 
Assess outcomes and be vocal about the group’s success!

 Building a viable and vibrant emerging technologies 
working group in an academic library may appear to be a daunting 
task, but it will most certainly reap benefits not only for your 
organization, but for the greater library community.  How new 
technologies can enhance learning is new territory and has often 
been approached in less than grounded ways.  It has been recently 
written, “This absence of highly visible successes and best 
practices increases the sense of frustration and concern and leaves 
the institutions without a lodestar.” (Trinkle, 2005) By taking 
ownership of this important new gap, establishing best practices 
and thoughtfully informing our institutions and colleagues, a 
bridge can be built to the libraries of the future where technologies 
enhance learning by being deliberate, sustainable, transparent and 
quality innovations to service.

familiar scenario.  You are part of a one-shot, 50-minute library 
orientation class—getting to know the librarian and the services of 
the library.  The instructor hasn’t tied your library session into any 
assignment.  We’ll also assume that, as the librarian handling this 
class, I haven’t taken a more active role in reframing the goals or 
outcomes of this library visit.
 I’ve already given you our classroom library handout, 
a quick overview of the library’s policies, and we’ve explored 
the library’s website.  We’ve done a database search or two, and 
perhaps I’ve taken time to have us email ourselves a sample article.  
Since we’re in a computer lab, you’ve been listening, watching, 
and clicking along dutifully.   
 At this point in our scenario, I might suggest that we 
end our session with a short discussion on evaluating resources. 
[LOEX participants are led through the  Evaluating Resources for 
the Technical Report  learning object.]  During this exercise students 
are asked to decide if seven sources are acceptable or unacceptable 
for use in a fictional paper on Artificial Intelligence ( http://www.

 The initial reaction to the learning object experience 
is usually positive; it is short, quick, engaging.  I have used this 
learning object several times with students from a variety of 
programs and classes.  Over time I modified my discussion of the 
resources and the correct answers, but as for delivery, I’ve most 
often used the “shout-out-the-answer” method we tried today.  
With each use I gained experience with pacing and got better at 
gauging student responses and their reactions.  And, depending on my goal, the learning object activity worked well.  I’ll revisit 
the idea of the goal or outcome of the instruction session when 
we discuss additional uses for learning objects a little later in the 
presentation.
 Let’s take a moment and explore how else I might have 
used this learning object.  [LOEX participants are encouraged to 
suggest additional ways to incorporate Evaluating Sources for a 
Technical Report  into a learning plan.] 
Suggested Activities Include:
• Learner-driven individual and small group activities:   
  pre-test to check learner’s prior knowledge of the   
  content; progress check after content has been presented;  
  re-testing to check application of their evaluation skills.
• Instructor-led large and small group activities:  students
  note their answers to the interactive portion of the   
  learning object and turn in the results; students   
  discuss/list the evaluation criteria used to make   
  a judgment on each source.
• Online or correspondence course: the learning   
  object might be used as an assigned activity, a pre-test,  
  or review.  (Langan, T.,  Learning , Langan, T., Putting )
 As a librarian at a Wisconsin Technical College, my 
introduction to learning objects was through the work done by 
the Wisconsin Online Resource Center and their development of 
Wisc-Online.  Our opening learning object is from their online 
repository.  
wi sC-onLi n e

16 two-year Wisconsin Technical Colleges, is a digital library of Web-

online course resource page, or a PowerPoint.  Students open and view 
the learning object directly from the link.  There is no need to visit the 
main Wisc-Online website. (Chitwood, K., May, C., Bunnow, D., & 
Langan, T., 2000).

 So what exactly is a learning object?  It appears answering 
that question is as difficult as answering, “What is a librarian?”  
Many people have tried.  David A. Wiley, a pioneer in this area, is 
credited with the broadest and most succinct definition.  Learning 
objects are “any digital resource that can be reused to support 
learning” (Wiley, 2000).  This sounds reasonable, but that definition 
would include almost anything and everything online, as a learning 
object.   A lengthier definition, often quoted by educators working 
with learning objects, is based on the definitions offered by Wisc-
Online.  Learning objects are “reusable, portable, web-enabled 
learning chunks—small bits and pieces of learning activities and 
assessments that can be used alone or combined and re-combined 
to customize courses and parts of courses” (Chitwood, K., et al., 
2000).   They are searchable, based on a clear instructional strategy, 
and provide easy access to just-in-time, just enough, just-for-you 
learning.  (About Wisc-Online, 2005).
 There is an extended body of literature on the protracted 
debate over learning objects’ precise definition. (Downes, n.d., 
Wiley, 2000) While it makes for interesting reading, that level 
of background is not needed to understand and use them.  Wisc-
Online’s definitions will serve our needs. 
TYp e s o f Le a r n i n g  oB JeC Ts
 Learning objects can be assessments, lectures, simulations, 
or case studies.  They can offer drill and practice giving students 
multiple opportunities to test themselves on the material.  They can 
be animations of a concept, a procedure, a tool.  
 This variety serves the needs and multiple learning styles 
of students from diverse backgrounds.  The learning objects’ 
flexibility allows for use in a variety of learning environments.  
Let’s explore some of that variety by looking at the resources 
available through Wisc-Online ( http://www.wisc-online.com/
default.as p).
  
 After registering, a user enters the learning object 
collection. Objects are organized into seven broad subject areas.  
It is a quick process to examine each of the areas and identify 
the subdivision or course you’d like to explore.  Searching across 
disciplines, by concepts or content, is easy using the search feature.  
Searching for objects by type, author, or college is also useful.
 A little background on the project’s development will shed 
some light on the distribution of learning objects in the subject  
areas, and explain why I think this collection provides opportunities for others to find useful materials.  Wisc-Online’s original grant 
focused on developing objects for the nine General Education 
“core” courses in the Wisconsin Technical College System.  The 
WTCS ascribes to a performance-based curriculum development 
design philosophy called The Worldwide Instructional Design 
System or WIDS .  Any course written for WTCS is required to 
use competencies and performance standards as the foundational 
elements for the course.   The competencies for the nine core 
courses were agreed on statewide in the early 1990s, hence Wisc-
Online’s focus on these courses.  (Chitwood, K., et al., 2000).
The core courses include:
• Oral/Interpersonal Communication
• Speech 
• Technical Reporting
• Written Communication
• Contemporary American Society 
• Economics
• Introduction to Psychology
• Introduction to Sociology 
• Psychology of Human Relations
 These core courses are reflected in the curriculums 
of colleges and universities around the world, and I suspect the 
competencies are similar as well.  Creating activities or learning 
chunks that can be used and reused in a variety of ways is what 
Wisc-Online is all about.  Focusing on the types of courses offered 
at most schools increases the likelihood of a learning object’s 
transferability. [LOEX participants viewed several learning objects 
illustrating a variety of types and content areas.  ( http://www.wisc-
online.com/default.as p).]
Us i n g Le a r n i n g  oB JeC Ts  
 Let’s revisit our opening learning object activity.  I 
mentioned evaluating its success based on my goals for the activity.  
My goals for my library instruction have changed significantly 
over the past two years.  I no longer go willingly into the catch-
all 50-minute library session.  Now, planning for every session 
begins with my asking faculty, “What do you want the students to 
be able to do after this session?”  I focus on information literacy 
competencies and transferable skills rather than “showing the 
website” orientations or library visits.  I have not used this activity 
in the past two years because it seemed too limited.  It was part 
of my “old” style of instruction.  In preparing this presentation 
and thinking about the various ways to use learning objects, I 
realized that this object could work successfully as a supplement 
to evaluation activities I currently use.  I’m looking forward to 
having students use their evaluation criteria to assess each source 
as an in-class review.
 This brings up an important consideration when looking 
at learning objects.  Remain flexible and open to their possibilities.  
I’ve discussed learning objects with a number of faculty, and 
some see only faults with them; others see the possibilities.  Over 
a year ago, a dental histology instructor requested help locating 
Lo e x-2006    73 -gr a i n s  o f Le a r n i n g : Le a r n i n g  oB JeC Ts & L iBr a r Y in sTrU C T i o n-activities to enliven a dry, difficult subject matter.  While there 
are a few learning objects for dental hygiene, there was nothing 
in any of the other subject areas that covered her topics.  She saw 
the possibilities: using animation to enliven and illustrate content, 
a method to provide review and assessment activities to her 
course.   She partnered with another faculty member and obtained 
curriculum development money to have two learning objects 
created for their courses.  They’ll be using them by fall.      
 Another successful way that I’ve used learning objects is 
as an activity resource library.  Need an activity on a particular topic 
or subject area?  Working on a transferable competency that might 
have been addressed by a learning object from another discipline?  
Communication and critical thinking skills, for example, are core 
abilities that all disciplines and programs attempt to foster in their 
students.  
 Another dental instructor asked me for resources for her class 
on Nutrition and Oral Health.  After I asked about the curriculum and 
competencies addressed in the class, I realized that an object from the 
dietary manager training series would be a perfect activity for the dental 
class.  That object was the Understanding the Nutrition Facts Label 
learning object, we viewed earlier.  The instructor loved the activity, but 
knew she would not be able to use it online.  Y et, she wanted to use it as 
an in-class activity.  I suggested she bring in her own cereal labels, and we 
could scan them.  We were able to duplicate the learning object activities 
in a Word document that she uses as a review and assessment tool.  
LoCaTi n g Le a r n i n g  oB JeC Ts
 To discover what’s out there, I recommend starting 
with the Center for International Education at the University of 
Wisconsin—Milwaukee’s website.  This site has annotated listings 
of collections of learning objects as well as a detailed bibliography 
of papers written on this topic.  Their collection listings include 
general, discipline-specific, and commercial repositories. ( http://
www.uwm.edu/Dept/CIE/AOP/learningobjects.htm l)
Three general collections worth investigating are:
• LoLa Exchange: Learning Objects, Learning Activities.   
 Wesleyan partnered with NITLE (the National Institute  
 for Technology and Liberal Education) to create a   
 national repository of learning objects for use   
 in undergraduate education. Their listings    
 include descriptions for each object/activity.    
 They provide links to resources and do not host   
 the materials; contributors self-describe resources.   
 ( http://www.lolaexchange.or g)
• Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and On- 
 Line Teaching (MERLOT) is a free and open resource  
 designed primarily for faculty and students of higher    
 education. Because materials are not stored    
 on MERLOT, it requires more time to click through to  
 each resource.  Resources are screened and attempts 
 are made to keep links current, but I have found the   
 results are mixed. Contributors self-describe resources.  ( http://cats.merlot.org/Home.p o)
• Wisc-Online hosts the learning objects in their   
 collection; searching, viewing, and linking to them is a  
 breeze. ( http://www.wisc-online.com /)
 
 A few cautions or lessons learned from searching through 
many websites looking at objects:  First, it will take longer than 
you think.  Learning objects are addictive; they are so short and 
sound so intriguing, “just one more,” becomes a mantra.  Second, 
searching within collections is not created equal.  Not all collections 
use metadata, or controlled vocabulary, or accurate descriptors.  
Even if they do, they rarely agree (no universal standard enforced), 
nor are they always reviewed by the host site.  Often the person 
submitting a learning object, activity, or tutorial to a collection 
clearinghouse is responsible for “tagging” the learning object with 
descriptors.  Descriptors are often inaccurate, incomplete, or used 
inconsistently.   As librarians we’re able to weather these challenges 
better than most users, but be aware of the pitfalls.  Wisc-Online is 
a good example of a site that has strict quality standards, including 
approved metadata, for its learning objects.  That makes searching 
for objects an easy, consistent process.

 Many, if not most, of the Wisc-Online learning objects are 
created using Macromedia Flash by technical developers on their staff.  
The developers are specialists with the software, and now have years 
of experience creating learning objects.  An interior decorator, if asked, 
would probably say their goal is to bring the client’s dreams to reality, 
and yet, each interior decorator brings a particular style to their designs. 
The same is true with learning objects and technical developers.  It is 
possible to search the learning object database by author and developer.  
Many of the learning objects we looked at today were done by one 
developer.  
 Donna Marconnet, the librarian responsible for our online 
tutorials, uses Macromedia Captivate, formerly RoboDemo.  Captivate 
is marketed as easy to use with no programming or multimedia skills 
required and provides an easy way to develop Flash animation without 
knowing Flash.  Donna has been able to create professional products 
without spending huge amounts of time learning complex software.  
The most challenging task is the design of each tutorial, from concept 
through storyboard to the final product.  [LOEX participants viewed 
an example of a Captivate tutorial. http://matcmadison.edu/library/
library/instruction/Tutorial/Default.htm]  
 If you’d like to design your own learning objects, Wisc-
Online provides information and support for faculty content builders 
(http://www.wisc-online.com/members/resources/builders.as p).  They 
also offer a number of contracted services, including workshops on 
Macromedia Flash, and designing, developing, and delivering learning 
objects, along with template tools.  All their services, along with costs 
are detailed online.  Sample estimates for a typical learning object, 
developed from production-ready scripts and media, are $500-700.

 Learning objects speak to today’s diverse learning community.  
Learning objects work in today’s diverse learning environments.   
Sharing and adapting learning objects makes good economic sense in 
today’s budget climate.  Try them, adapt them, I think you’ll like them, 
because I’ve found that learning objects are fun.

conference, several colleagues at my institution expressed an 
interest in acquiring such a system. Not being familiar with this 
technology, I approached our Computing and Communications 
(C & C) department on campus. I learned that this technology 
was already being widely used on campus. The campus was 
exclusively employing the system from the H-ITT company, 
Hyper-Interactive Teaching Technology. In preparing my 
proposal, I researched two vendors, H-ITT and the InterWrite 
system from GTCO. In the proposal to the University Librarian, 
both systems were put forth; however, a strong preference for 
the H-ITT system was indicated. Acquiring a system already 
in use on campus meant students would be familiar with it and 
the library would have technical support from the Computing 
and Communications department. 
 H-ITT is a classroom response system that allows 
real-time interaction between the class and the instructor. The 
librarian asks the class a multiple choice or true and false 
question using the software, and the students respond using 
‘clickers,’ two-way remote control devices. It engages students 
through immediate, anonymous feedback. 
 The library purchased its classroom response system 
in 2005. It was installed immediately and began being used 
heavily in the Fall of that same year. Once the system was 
installed, the reference/instruction librarians, along with faculty 
on campus, received training from C & C. We use it for one-
shot bibliographic instruction sessions for undergraduate and 
graduate level classes that are either 50 minutes or 90 minutes 
long. 
 
 Our purpose for obtaining the ‘clicker’ system was two-fold. We wanted to engage the students, to get them 
responding to our questions during class. Second, we use 
the system as an assessment tool. We wanted to go beyond 
knowing if the students thought the library session was useful 
to knowing if they were truly learning what we were teaching. 
We wanted to know what skills we should focus on and what 
was easily understood by the students that we did not have to 
emphasize.
The H-ITT system is comprised of three components: 
1.  The receiver(s), 
2.  The remote controls, and 
3.  The software. 
 The number of receivers needed is determined by 
the number of students that will be ‘answering’ to each one. 
It is recommended there be approximately one receiver 
per twenty students. The software consists of two separate 
modules: the acquisitions module and the analyzer module. 
The acquisitions module is used to acquire responses 
from the students. The class can see this module during 
the instruction session, thereby allowing everyone to see 
the results of the class as a whole. The analyzer module 
provides the librarians with the results of the questions; it 
is not visible to the students. Using the analyzer module, 
the librarian receives a file that contains the answer key, 
students’ points, individual student responses, the question 
analysis, and the roster of students.

This graph shows the instructor how many students got each question correct or incorrect. This

 There are both advantages and challenges involved in using 
a classroom response system. One of the greatest advantages from 
a student’s perspective is the anonymity it provides. When students 
respond, it is completely anonymous. This allows students who would 
otherwise be reluctant to express themselves to see that they may not 
be the only person having difficulty. For the instructor, a system such as 
this increases student involvement, requiring the students to participate 
in the class. An additional advantage for the instructor is the immediate 
feedback s/he receives from the system. Instantly the instructor and the 
student see the comprehension level of the class.
 Using a classroom response system also poses some challenges. 
Developing good, conceptually-based questions can be difficult and time 
consuming. The questions should also be created in advance. The system 
is not best suited for questions asked on the fly. Asking questions while 
teaching can also slow the pace of the class slightly. Receiving immediate 
feedback on the students learning further implies that, as the instructor, 
you are going to respond to their level of comprehension and adjust the 
content of the instruction accordingly. Therefore, using a classroom 
response system works best with a flexible teaching style. 
 Overall, the clickers were very well received by both students 
and faculty. Students felt they paid more attention when they knew 
they were going to be asked questions about the material. They also 
recognized that the anonymity would make students feel less self-
conscious when answering questions. Faculty also felt they made a big impression on their class. Generally, the system did help us accomplish 
our goals. The students were more engaged and as the librarians we 
learned where our instruction needed to be focused.

 Learning information seeking skills in a wired classroom 
presents the learner and instructor with an array of cognitive, 
environmental and pedagogical challenges that can either enhance 
or hinder the learning experience.  Many library instruction sessions 
contain an inherent disconnect between goals and motivations: the 
instructor is attempting to build information seeking skills while 
the learner is focused on the act of finding material.  Teaching 
the search process in a one-shot session reveals a complex set of 
design considerations including time, task complexity, quantity of 
content, and user demographics.  This paper utilizes cognitive load 
theory and learning style theory to posit a model of pre-assessment 
known as SCILL: Subject knowledge, Community, Information 
technology competency, Library and internet awareness and 
Learning style. Each of these facets are interdependent and distinct 
and provide a way for the instructor to determine the level of 
instruction, appropriate content and suitable instruction technique 
for a given audience.

 The ability to formulate, structure and reformulate 
keywords is of primary concern when working with an 
information retrieval system such as a database of abstracts or a 
search engine.  The subject knowledge, or domain knowledge, of 
students in the class is an important consideration for instructional 
design. Wildemuth (2004) and Anghelescu (2005) show that as a 
student’s domain knowledge increases so does a student’s ability 
to formulate and use different search terms in their online searches 
The importance of domain knowledge is heightened in the one-
shot library session.  When designing a session for teaching 
searching skills in a computer-based environment it is important to take the students’ domain knowledge into account as students 
will combine what they learn in your session with their existing 
domain knowledge to find materials for their academic activities.  
This process of knowledge application during the one-shot can be 
theoretically framed within Brown, Collins and Duguid’s notion of 
cognitive apprenticeship which claims that:
The activity in which knowledge is 
developed and deployed, it is now 
argued, is not separable from or 
ancillary to learning and cognition.  Nor 
is it neutral. Rather, it is an integral part 
of what is learned.  Situations might be 
said to co-produce knowledge through 
activity.  Learning and cognition, it is 
now possible to argue are fundamentally 
situated (Brown, Collins, Duguid, 
1989, p. 32).
 Students with a low level of domain knowledge will have 
large gaps in their understanding of the field. How can an information 
seeker specify a request to an information retrieval system describing 
what it is that he or she does not know–and therefore needs to retrieve 
(Ford, 2004, p.771)?  These students may not have the ability to 
formulate initial keywords or to revise their search strategies. 
Conversely, students with a high degree of domain knowledge can 
be very competent with developing keywords and may not require 
instruction on how to develop and deploy keyword search strategies 
(Vakkari, 2003); these experienced students would instead benefit 
from instruction on advanced search strategies, relevance assessment 
or alternative resource selection.  When working in settings where 
the students may not have a strongly developed vocabulary for their 
field the instructor can choose to reduce the cognitive load on the 
students by highlighting features of the search tool that require the 
lowest level of term development.  Alternatively they can choose to 
focus a larger part of the session on how to identify tools that can 
help with term generation and selection.ho w Th eY Le a r n /ho w YoU Te aCh: BUiLd i n g LiBr a r Y

 The audience diversity in each library instruction 
session makes for a unique learning community.  In this section 
community refers to the similarity or dissimilarity of your 
learners’ characteristics. Research shows that people with different 
demographic characteristics conceptualize and engage in the 
information seeking process differently.  While an entire class may 
all have a subject interest or course in common, similarity within 
this community likely ends there.  Factors such as educational 
attainment, age, gender and English language skills demand sensitive 
instructional adaptation to these individual needs.  The Millennial 
population may comprise a large portion of your academic library 
instruction audience, but some students may be older and their 
learning needs will be significantly different than their younger 
counterparts (Gold, 2005).  Zhang and Chignell (2001) found that 
educational attainment effected how users approached information 
retrieval systems and determined their success in using information 
retrieval systems regardless of their familiarity with the material.  
Information seeking can also be impacted by factors such as 
gender (Mahar, Henderson & Deane, 1997) and age (Laguna & 
Babcock, 1997).   Taking steps to accommodate the demographic 
characteristics of your class can enhance the learning experience 
overall (Whitmire, 2001).  Gaining a demographic understanding 
of the potential audience of your library instruction session will 
allow you to target content and activities appropriately.

 One of the major considerations of teaching in a wired 
classroom is your students’ skill level with the various technologies 
being used. Learning information seeking skills in a technologically 
mediated setting is a cognitively challenging activity.  Using a computer 
and navigating the interfaces of databases and library websites all 
require cognitive complexity to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.  
Learning activities such as problem-based learning place a high 
cognitive load demand on novice searchers. Chandler and Sweller 
(1991) showed that though students can display in-class success when 
engaged in problem-based learning the high cognitive load demands 
imposed by engaging in the activity “, were ineffective as learning 
devices. The extraneous cognitive load imposed by the problem solving 
strategy interfered with learning (294).” Each individual is only capable 
of supporting a certain level of cognitive load before short term memory 
is overwhelmed and learning halted. To enhance the potential learning 
in your session it is important to anticipate areas of your sessions that 
can increase cognitive load.  If these areas are not directly related to 
what you are teaching their inclusion should be reconsidered.  When 
planning activities for high cognitive load situations the use of step-by-
step instructions and examples that lead to full or partial solutions are 
more effective in facilitating learning (Merrienboer et al 2002, 13).
LiBr a r Y aw a r e n e s s  a n d an x i e T Y
 Jiao and Onwuegbuzie’s research on demographic aspects 
of library usage trends revealed much about gender, ethnicity and 
academic experience as related to library usage and anxiety (2000; 1997).  By knowing what library awareness your students already 
possess you will spend less time telling people things they already 
know and can instead focus on dispelling any myths if necessary.  
Kuhlthau’s model of the library search process with respect to 
library awareness or anxiety outlines considerations for librarians 
preparing to teach the one-shots.  Library anxiety implications 
can persist in any of the six search stages: task initiation; topic 
selection; pre-focus exploration; focus formulation; information 
collection; and search closure (1991).  Depending on the subject 
of the workshop and the characteristics of the students, certain 
strategies that focus on alleviating potential library anxiety can 
be anticipated.  Contextualizing each one-shot session may reveal 
that the greatest potential for library unfamiliarity or anxiety is, for 
example, in the information collection stage.

 Learning theory is a vast field of research in which 
many learning style theories exist.  Some of the more popular 
approaches include: Kolb; Dunn and Dunn; McCarthy; Gregorc; 
and, Grasha and Riechmann. Despite the multitude of competing 
theories, most scholars agree that in the very least “[s]tyles are 
people’s preferred modes of processing information” (Sternberg 
& Grigorenko, 1997).  There is no unifying theoretical framework 
for learning styles in general or for library instruction specifically, 
but there are generally accepted best pedagogical practices based 
on constructivist teaching and learning theory.  These include: 
authentic time-on-task; ample feedback; varied and adaptable 
instruction; awareness of learning and teaching theory; making 
learning a social activity; presenting material in manageable 
components; and building on prior knowledge.  These best practices 
are based on the acknowledgment that learning and teaching are 
reciprocally connected, and that as there is no single way to learn 
there can be no single way to teach.  Very simply, learning improves 
when instruction improves.  While each approach is unique, much 
commonality exists such as recognition that some students prefer to 
observe, while others are visual, some are tactile, some like group 
work, while others prefer independent learning.  Fenstermacher 
& Goodlad prudently observed that “[d]iversity among learners 
complicates the task of reaching common goals for all learners” 
(1983, p. 7); making our task doubly difficult when we consider 
the instructional challenges inherent in one-shot library sessions 
in a wired setting.  . In their work on teaching web page creation 
Chou and Wang (1999), have demonstrated that there is a positive 
correlation between Kolb’s learning styles and instruction format 
and task success and computer anxiety. Targeting your instructional 
technique to the learning styles that will be present in your class 
can have an impact on the quality of student learning and reduce 
computer anxiety.
Co nC L U s i o n
 The SCILL model outlines a series of considerations that 
should be taken into account when planning a one-shot session in a 
wired classroom setting. Pre-assessing your audience’s individual 
characteristics can help you maximize the effectiveness and relevance 
Lo e x-2006    83 -ho w Th eY Le a r n /ho w YoU Te aCh:...-of your instruction.  Asking registrants or potential audiences to fill out 
a pre-class questionnaire can provide useful information about what 
kind of activities will deliver the most impact as well as information 
about which aspects of the class are likely to be problematic. These 
surveys can be automated using web-based survey software such as 
Survey Monkey or using the survey modules of course management 
software available on your campus. By utilizing the SCILL set criteria 
you can build instruction modules that cater to your audiences, needs, 
concerns, learning styles and skill level while ensuring that their 
weaknesses do not hinder the learning moment.

comprehensive library web site revamping, and a three-year building 
renovation project, the library instruction division decided to take 
advantage of the spirit of change present in our organization to help 
us rethink our approach to developing online resources. Discussions in 
library instruction community and the broader educational technology 
community sparked numerous ideas, and we needed to determine where 
to prioritize our efforts. Keeping a user-centered approach in mind, we 
examined the latest trend reports and information behavior literature 
for insight into what technologies students are using and how they are 
using them. Based on this research, we developed a pilot study in order 
to test our assumptions about students’ access to and use of mobile 
computing and communication technologies. The findings helped us 
to focus our efforts towards developing instructional resources that we 
believe will be most effective and useful for our students.
BaC Kg r o Un d
 It’s not an exaggeration to say that the internet has changed 
almost everything. By now the characteristics of the “net-gen,” “next-
gen,” or “millenial” generation are familiar to most educators. We 
are expecting our future students to be format-agnostic, nomadic, 
collaborative, adaptive, used to multitasking, and to be leading 
lives integrated with technology (Dede, 2005; Holliday & Li, 2004; 
Lippincott, 2005). On the technology front, the current New Media 
Consortium Horizon report (2006) tells us to expect social computing 
and personal broadcasting to meet critical mass within the year, that 
broader uses of cell phones and educational gaming are close behind, 
and that we can look forward to context-aware devices within five 
years. Futurists such as Howard Rheingold (2002) have demonstrated 
that current technological innovations influence cultural paradigms. 
For example, flash mobs have organized across the world via text 
messages to facilitate political activism. Bloggers influence everything from political campaigns to the latest American Idol  contestant. 
Current events are often first reported at the “street-level” as in the 
case of the 2005 London bombings, the first reports and images of 
which were transmitted from witnesses on the street via mobile 
phone. The interplay between new communication channels and new 
information is of particular interest to information science. Such a 
dynamic environment causes the concept of information literacy itself 
to take on new dimensions. How best to “teach” information literacy 
is a perpetually challenging question.
 Lippincott (2005) offers several ways for library instruction 
to adapt to new technologies and the “new” students who are being 
educated in an internet-centric world. First, she recommends thinking 
about information like students do, as typically available anytime 
and anywhere (57). She advises librarians to look at how and when 
students access information, stating, “One-on-one services offered 
electronically should be tailored to students’ characteristics, such as 
their propensity to work late hours and use a variety of technologies, 
including laptops and cell phones” (58). Lippincott mentions blogging, 
gaming, and pervasive multimedia as key trends to consider and 
stresses the need to develop more visually sophisticated instructional 
content.
 Technology trend reports generally support Lippincott’s 
assertions. The Pew Internet and American Life project studies the 
social effects of the internet on Americans and keeps longitudinal 
data about the adoption of the internet and related technologies 
over time. As of April 2006, the project reports that 73% of all 
adults use the internet and that 88% of adults between the ages 
of 18-29 do. The most popular online activities are email (91%), 
using a search engine (91%), and finding directions (84%). More 
than half of internet users do research for school or training (57%), 
access audio or video online (56%), or do job related research 
(50%). Emerging activities include taking virtual tours (45%), 
instant messaging (37%), photo sharing (34%), and online gaming 
(31%). Podcasting, blogging, and file sharing were activities of 
less than 30% of adult internet users as of mid-2005. iMp aC Ts o f MoBiLe CoMpU Ti n g a n d CoM M U n iCaTi o n o n LiBr a r Y

 86    L o e x-2006   -sa r a h  Bo s a r g e  a n d Ka r e n  esT L U n d- Pew’s more focused look at how internet use differs between 
men and women found that “Men go online in greater numbers than 
women for a vast, but scattered array of other activities. Women outpace 
men for a small number of activities” (Fallows, 2005, ii). The study 
also found that more women than men use email to communicate and 
that, in general, men tend to be more aggressive consumers of online 
information (iv). Men are also significantly more likely to be familiar 
with the latest technological trends, try new gadgets and software, and 
be confident about themselves as “searchers and geeks” (v). 
 The project’s look at teens and technology suggests that 
these trends are likely to change significantly. Lenhart, Madden, & 
Hitlin (2005) sum up the findings of their study in its title: “Teens and 
technology: Youth are leading the transition to a fully wired and mobile 
nation.” Eighty-seven percent of teens use the internet and 51% use it 
daily. In significant contrast to adults, 81% of teen internet users play 
games online and 75% use instant messaging, the majority of those on 
a daily basis (i). Girls between the ages of 15 and 17 were found to be 
internet power users, surpassing boys their own age and younger boys 
and girls in their level of internet use and engagement (v). Among teens 
there is no perceived gender gap between girls and boys with regards to 
comfort with internet technologies.
MeTh o d o Lo gY
 Given the fact that our primary users, current undergraduate 
students, probably exhibit characteristics of both adult and teen users, 
we wanted to test some of the national Pew Internet and American Life 
project findings with our local population. We developed a short online 
questionnaire to find out how often our students use certain mobile 
devices and internet technologies. A pilot sample of undergraduate 
students was invited to complete the questionnaire via an email invitation 
from their writing instructor. Students in required undergraduate 
writing courses were targeted in order to poll a representative sample 
of undergraduates from all colleges. Participation was not required and 
a drawing for a bookstore gift certificate was offered as an incentive 
to complete the questionnaire. As a pilot study, the questionnaire was 
designed to surface general trends to follow up with more formal 
research.
sU M M a rY o f fi n d i n g s
 Out of 32 total respondents, 53.1% were male and 46.9% 
female. The mean age of respondents was 19 and respondents 
identified themselves as majoring within nearly every college at the 
university with 18.8% identifying as undeclared. This initial sample, 
though small, is demographically representative of our undergraduate 
population.
 
 Respondents were asked to rate their use of the following 
mobile electronic devices: mobile phones; digital and digital video 
cameras; digital audio players; desktop, laptop, tablet, and handheld 
computers; text messaging devices; GPS locators; personal and 
console gaming devices; and smart watches. Respondents were most 
likely to use mobile phones (87.5%), desktop computers (78%), laptop 
computers (59%), digital audio players (56%), and digital cameras (53%). Respondents were least likely to use GPS locators and smart 
watches.
 
 With regards to social internet technologies, respondents were 
given a set of statements about blogs, multimedia file sharing, online 
gaming, and participation in online communities and were asked to 
respond Yes, No, or Don’t Know  to each statement. Respondents were 
most likely to download music or audio content from an online service 
such as iTunes (62%), visit a virtual community website such as 
MySpace (50%), and listen to audio or video broadcasts on a computer 
(46.8%). Respondents were less likely to regularly read blogs (28%) 
or play multiplayer online games (6%). When asked if they would 
be interested in having course-related information provided as either 
RSS feeds or audio broadcast, only 12.5% were interested in receiving 
course support via RSS, but 78% expressed interest in downloading 
course-related audio content to a computer or digital audio player.
di sC Us s i o n  a n d QUe sTi o n s f o r fUrTh e r an aL Ys i s
 The most significant finding was respondents’ strong use 
of electronic devices and internet technologies for accessing audio 
content. Although no respondents reported using a mobile phone to 
listen to music, 50% of those with a digital audio player report using 
it daily and 70.6% of laptop owners say they listen to music on their 
laptops. Our findings demonstrate that a majority of respondents are 
comfortable with finding, accessing, and downloading audio files from 
the internet. Given respondents’ stated interest in having course-related 
audio content available, this presents a key area of focus for developing 
new library instruction resources.    
 
 Given their pervasiveness, mobile phones also present a 
key technology instruction librarians might consider in developing 
new resources and programs. Mobile phones present interesting 
challenges for educators and libraries. The Qualifications and 
Curriculum Authority which monitors testing standards in the British 
school system recently reported that cheating on exams has risen by 
more than 25% and that mobile phone related cheating accounted for 
25% of total offences (Castle, 2006). Librarians are often divided on 
the use of mobile phones in libraries, but phone friendly libraries are 
becoming more common and phone and text messaging reference as 
well as classroom polling via phone are all being explored in libraries 
and library instruction. Fifty-six percent of our respondents use their 
mobile phones for text messaging and, while text messaging might 
not be an appropriate communication medium for extended reference 
service, it is a prevalent communication tool to consider when thinking 
about library services.
 
 In spite of recent interest in online gaming as a potential 
model for library instruction, our findings did not support a need for an 
immediate educational gaming strategy. Fifty percent of respondents 
reported owning a console gaming device, but only 21.8% reported 
owning a personal gaming device. Interestingly, among our respondents 
women were slightly more likely to own personal or console gaming 
devices then men, but this survey did not collect usage statistics for 
these devices. As stated previously, online gaming is not a primary 
activity of our respondents; however, the impacts of gaming, especially 
multiplayer online gaming, are not to be completely discounted. The 
Lo e x-2006    87 -iMp aC Ts o f MoBiLe CoMpU Ti n g a n d CoM M U n iCaTi o n...-Pew Internet and American Life Project reports that 81% of internet 
users between the ages of 12 and 17 play games online compared 
with 54% of users age 18-28 and only 37% of users age 29-40 (Fox & 
Madden, 2005). Gaming trends and the impact of gaming on social and 
cognitive behavior are issues to watch for the soon incoming “digital 
natives.” 
 
 Respondents showed significant participation in online 
communities in general by both maintaining their own spaces (46.8%) 
and visiting other peoples’ spaces (50%), but reported only minimal 
participation in higher education specific spaces (21.8%). The library 
blogosphere has recently speculated about the value of setting up 
library services in virtual communities, but it is important to consider 
not just how often students use these spaces, but also how they use 
them. Would students welcome the academic library’s presence in 
all facets of the online world, or resent the infiltration of “authority” 
into a largely informal and social space? Brian Mathews, a librarian 
at Georgia Tech has started mining student blogs for keywords such 
as assignment , help, librarian , and paper  that alert him to possible 
reference transactions. He then contacts students through their blogs 
or email. Mathews reports that students have been “receptive” to his 
“intrusions” and that they view him as “an equal participant, rather 
than as an intrusive outsider” (2006). The use potential of this type 
of librarian-initiated contact, while proactive and perhaps welcome, 
requires more research into students’ expectations and willingness to 
participate. Our respondents expressed a lack of interest in receiving 
course-related content via blogs and RSS feeds. Further research is 
needed to follow up on the reasons for this preference.
Lo oKi n g ah e a d
 Based on our findings we are focusing on developing audio 
content to support library instruction. We are currently developing 
audio tours aimed at specific audiences of students including new 
graduate students and students enrolled in first-year writing classes. An 
LSTA grant was secured to purchase several video iPods to circulate 
for students who do not have digital audio players of their own. We are 
considering how else audio content might support library instruction, 
including podcasting research tips and tricks, and audio clips throughout 
the library website. The library can also take an active leadership role 
in promoting the educational use of this technology on campus by 
having a comprehensive copyright policy that includes audio files and 
also by helping faculty to access or create multimedia content for their 
courses.
 
 The percentage of our respondents who are blogging 
corresponds with Pew findings for the U.S. adult population. Only 28% 
of our respondents reported reading blogs regularly and only 3% use 
an aggregator such as Bloglines to organize their blog reading. 81.3% 
responded that they either did not want course content delivered via 
RSS or didn’t know. Although respondents did not express a preference 
for receiving course content via RSS feed, this remains a technology to watch, especially since it is inexpensive and easy to integrate. 
 
 The pilot study was helpful in showing us where to focus 
our immediate efforts and for helping us to define questions for further 
research. Future research will include conducting focus groups with 
specialized groups of students and a revision of our pilot study survey 
with  continual implementation in on going years to measure change.  
In addition, as we begin to implement various technology solutions 
and library instruction, we will perform outcome based assessments. 
As we evaluate the results of our studies, we must keep in mind that 
students with various learning styles may be benefited or inhibited by 
the choices we make.

concepts to students no longer works.  To reach the undergraduate 
student of today, who is competent and excited about technology, 
librarians must explore new approaches to instruction.  This 
includes being open and flexible to ideas and methods that may 
at first seem foreign and uncomfortable.  Technology and the 
excitement it holds for undergraduates provides a perfect vehicle 
for librarians to take advantage of and to adapt for teaching 
information concepts and skills.  
 Today’s incoming college freshmen are part of the 
millennial generation, students born between 1980 and 2000.  As 
with Baby Boomers and Generation Xers before them, they have 
certain characteristics and expectations that set them apart from 
previous generations.  Sometimes called the “internet generation”, 
these students do not remember a time without technology so they 
are both comfortable with and knowledgeable about it. As a whole 
they prefer immediate and quick responses thus the preference 
for instant messaging.  They are very social and collaborative in 
nature as seen by their preference for working in groups.  
 As Millennials were growing up their parents were involved 
in their lives to the point of organizing and micro-managing their 
activities in a supervised and structured environment.  As a result, 
Millennials prefer structure and organization.  Their parents often 
intercede on their behalf to ensure they were being treated equally 
and were in a safe environment.  Millennials were consistently 
catered to and told how special they were. Their parents invested in 
their lives stressing self-esteem and confidence, creating in them a 
strong sense of self-worth that is translated into a “can do” attitude.  
Learning is non-linear for Millennials.  The typical Millennial may 
do homework while listening to music and watching television or 
talking with friends on the computer.  They gather information 
from multiple sources often learning through experiential activities rather than through textbook reading.  Above all else they prefer 
learning that is engaging, exciting and entertaining.

 Arizona State University (ASU) at the West campus is 
a community-focused metropolitan campus located in the west 
area of metropolitan Phoenix. The twenty-two year old campus, 
founded in 1984 as an upper-division campus, is one of four 
campuses of ASU. During the early years of the campus junior, 
senior and selected master’s degree programs were offered.  
 In fall 2001, the initial freshmen class of 269 students 
was admitted. At the same time the University charged a campus 
outcomes assessment team (COAT) with focusing on campus-wide 
assessment efforts. This team, including a librarian, created the 
campus-wide Categories of Learning Outcomes,  which included 
information and technology competencies, to assist with guiding 
and assessing instruction. These two events offered librarians 
a unique opportunity to further their agenda of integrating 
information competencies across the curriculum. 
 Using the West campus Library’s Information 
Competencies  developed in the early 1990s as the foundation, 
the Library’s Lower Division Implementation Team in 2001 
defined and developed a list of information competencies for first 
year students.  This list, now known as The Information Skills 
Outcomes for First Year Students,  formed the framework for a 
library curriculum emphasizing three levels of competency in 
the areas of library services, research processes, online catalog, 
database search techniques, evaluation, attribution and citation.
 Learning Communities were selected by the campus as 
a mechanism for creating a supportive learning environment for 
all freshmen during their first semester on campus.    Librarians 
collaborated with faculty in planning these and were guaranteed 
access to a minimum of two instructional sessions in each learning LeT Th e gaMe s Be g i n! Ch a n g i n g  oUr in sTrU C T i o n To re aCh

required to participate in a learning community. As a result of this 
change, librarians no longer reached a majority of first year students 
although they continued to have guaranteed access to learning 
communities. The freshmen English composition program opened 
another point of access to students.  This provided librarians with 
the opportunity to build a sequenced approach of instruction 
applied over several semesters. 
 To accommodate the changes in library instruction 
for freshmen, the position of Coordinator of Lower Division 
Instruction was created in November 2003.  In addition, a librarian 
hired on a term contract in 2004 was assigned to work with the 
lower division program in developing and delivering instruction. 
To help on a short-term basis a temporary librarian was asked 
to assist as needed and an intern was hired for a semester.  The 
Digital Design and Delivery Librarian provided technical support 
to the team in the development of online instructional tools. In 
2005 two library staff members working on their Master’s degrees 
in library and information science joined the team.  The Lower 
Division Instruction Team (LoDi) is charged with the development 
and delivery of instruction to English 101, English 102, WAC 101 
and Learning Community students.
 As part of creating a new LoDi team, members revisited 
The Information Skills Outcomes  to ensure full understanding of 
their meaning and to confirm skills and outcomes were assigned 
appropriately to courses in sequence.  This curriculum guides the 
development of instructional content specifying the tasks, skills, 
and processes that first year students must master in order to 
become information literate.

 Initially, instruction for the Learning Communities 
consisted of a virtual and real library tour exercise.  This 
performance-based exercise was used to introduce students to 
library services, the Library’s online catalog, differences between 
types of sources and collections, and how to read, understand, and 
use citations to retrieve information. This assignment was labor 
intensive for both students and librarians; it also did not engage the 
students.
 Once Learning Communities were no longer a requirement 
for incoming freshmen, this exercise was transferred to WAC 101 
and English 101 classes and new instruction was developed for 
Learning Communities.  
Ch a n g i n g  in sTrU C T i o n w iTh MiL Le n n i a Ls i n Mi n d
 From an initial class of 269 students in 2001, the number of 
freshmen climbed to over 400 in fall 2005 and the campus goal for 
fall 2006 is 600-800 first year students.  With the numbers of first-
year students growing at a greater rate than library staff, reaching 
students to teach library skills and concepts in a meaningful way is 
increasingly more difficult. In 2004 the LoDi Team began the process of changing 
instruction.  After researching the most effective ways to deliver 
instruction to Millennials, online learning objects and educational 
gaming were determined to be viable options.  Learning objects 
are interactive, experiential, and break content into small, easily 
absorbed pieces.  Game-based learning offers students a non-
threatening, fun and interactive mechanism that incorporates 
activities where learning about detailed and complex processes is 
engaging and meets students where they are. 
 Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) 101 is designed 
to build writing skills of students who are at risk.  Once students 
complete this pass/fail class, they enroll in English 101.  In the 
first year of the Library’s lower division instruction program, these 
students were given tour exercise, as were students in English 101 
classes.  Issues with this exercise and the problems inherent in 
duplicating instruction were recognized but the time to design new 
instruction for multiple courses while integrating a librarian, new to 
the profession and the campus, into the program was insufficient.  
 One year later  the team began to tackle the problem 
of designing engaging instructional activities or games that 
differentiate between the skills and concepts taught in WAC 101 
and English 101.  A race through the library game based loosely on 
the television program, The Amazing Race,  was created.  Students 
receive clues by locating information throughout the “race” and 
reporting it to appropriate library staff.  In addition to receiving 
one clue at a time they also receive puzzle pieces of the library 
floor plan to put together at the end of the game. Campus bookstore 
coupons were used as prizes. 
 While student feedback indicated that this activity was fun, 
there were some problems centering on service desk staff properly 
interacting with student players and providing the correct clues.  
 The three most important things students reported learning 
from this activity were where books are located, how to search the 
online catalog for media, and how to find a book on the shelf.

WebQuests
 As the former education librarian for the campus, the lower 
division coordinator was familiar with WebQuests, a structured 
inquiry-based approach to locating, evaluating, synthesizing and 
using information from the internet created originally by Bernie 
Dodge and Tom March in 1995.   She initiated a project to create 
a WebQuest as a learning object to introduce students in learning 
communities to searching, retrieving, and evaluating sources 
from both the Internet and a general subscription database. These 
WebQuests can be easily modified and updated by librarians to 
focus on the subject content of the individual learning community.  
Google is a familiar tool but most students are unaware of the 
advanced searching and limit techniques that allow them to focus 
a search.  In a guided approach, students were provided with a 
Lo e x-2006    91 -LeT Th e gaMe s Be g i n! Ch a n g i n g  oUr in sTrU C T i o n...-topic and specific search terms and limits to enter in Google.  After 
performing both basic and advanced Google searches, students 
compared and contrasted the results for use in an academic 
environment.  This same approach was used with a subscription 
database, Academic Search Premier .  Finally, results of the Google 
and database searches were compared and contrasted for relevance 
to an academic assignment.  In each section students were 
directed to identify the basic components of a citation.  Student 
feedback to this instructional approach has been positive overall.  
Many comments received indicate a better understanding of the 
differences between the Internet and subscription databases.  
The Research Process: Defining Research Needs
 English 102 students are typically assigned a research 
paper. They are expected to create a research plan, select and define 
a topic, search databases, select and retrieve sources, synthesize 
information and cite sources.
 Librarians negotiated two instructional sessions in these 
classes with the Composition Coordinator; however, with so many 
concepts to cover and a range of skill levels among the students it 
was difficult to sufficiently teach the basics of selecting, focusing 
and searching a topic.  To assist students, librarians reviewed their 
topics and search strategies between the instructional sessions but 
it was difficult to find time to review and comment on these in a 
short time.  
 After a semester, a learning object that would be part 
online tutorial, part online worksheet was created. Students entered 
their topic information including keywords and a search strategy 
and then emailed the information to a librarian for review prior 
to the first library instruction session.  This learning object, The 
Research Process: Defining Research Needs worksheet , introduced 
students to the research process as part of an information-seeking 
model.  This provided more in-class time for librarians to address 
and teach additional skills including synthesizing information. 
 Student feedback indicated that learning to search and 
navigate databases was the most useful part of the instruction they 
received.  They overwhelmingly indicated that what they learned 
would be useful in doing research in their other courses.
Th e ToUr ex e r Ci s e BeCoMe s a gaMe
 Instruction for students in English 101 originally 
consisted of the tour exercise that had been created for the Learning 
Communities and used in WAC101. Creation of an online version 
of the tour that could be administered and automatically graded 
online surfaced every semester. During fall 2004 the idea of 
investigating virtual reality as a delivery mechanism for teaching 
library skills began to gel.  As educational gaming had previously 
been identified as a method for reaching Millennials, the Game 
Project came into being.
 The Game Project was naively targeted for completion in August 2005, but after exploring online games, the team found that 
the project was too big to complete by then.  Instead the decision 
was made to design and pilot a traditional board game that could 
serve as a prototype for a computer-based game.  The project plan 
involved evaluation and assessment of the board game’s potential 
as a computer-based game.  
 The need to learn more about games in general was 
identified as a necessary step.  Several board games such as 
Clue  and Trivial Pursuit  were reviewed for game mechanics.  
Several different approaches were looked at including scenarios 
or “problems” that generated urgency in solving a dilemma and 
involved identifying, locating and evaluating information as an 
aspect of solving the problem.   A lot was learned about games 
through this process including just how different board games and 
computer-based games are.   
 The board game created by the LoDi Team involved 
students in interactive learning, incorporated chance, penalties 
and rewards and allowed non-librarians to deliver instruction.  It 
is scalable because it can be administered by anyone; is accurate 
because it was created by librarians; is instructive because it 
incorporates information about library services and types of 
resources; and is engaging because it is a team-based game.
 Student feedback about the board game was enthusiastic.  
Students indicated they had fun while learning about something 
they deemed as rather dry and boring.  Using a game appears 
to be an innovative and viable way to teach students about the 
information environment.
 The online game will introduce and focus on many of 
the same concepts as the board game but will take place in an 
action-oriented online environment.  Students will be engaged in a 
discovery learning activity that incorporates assessment of learning 
and provides players with immediate, automatic feedback of their 
actions.  The targeted completion date for the Game Project is now 
fall 2006.
 The use of a variety of interactive learning objects and 
games in the first year library instruction program engages Millennial 
students by appealing to their preferred learning style.  They provide 
for systematic and sustainable delivery mechanisms, contribute to the 
development of information proficient students, strengthen the library’s 
role in the education of students and reduce the remedial work required 
by liaison librarians in upper division classes.

 It seems like many libraries have created or are in 
the process of building an information literacy tutorial from 
scratch.  While we applaud their efforts and utilize their quality 
products, we do not have the time or the technical expertise 
to replicate their work.  However, with the availability of 
tutorials through open publication licenses and newer, user-
friendly software, we can create similar results given the 
limited resources at our disposal.

 The University of Evansville (UE) is a private, 
Methodist-affiliated, liberal arts and sciences, university with 
about 2,400 students.   All first-year students are required to take 
a two-semester “great books” sequence where faculty have the 
opportunity to introduce their students to information literacy 
skills through both online tools and face-to-face instruction.  
Using high-tech skills and low-tech software, Meg Atwater-
Singer has modified several information literacy tutorials for 
student use.  
 The University of Southern Indiana (USI) is a state 
institution that serves approximately 10,000 students. USI 
Office of Instructional Technology Services provides faculty 
with access to software that individual departments, including 
the library, might not otherwise be able to afford, software 
such as Adobe’s Breeze and Captivate. Susan Metcalf checked 
with IT Services and was able to benefit from user-friendly, 
high-tech software.   in Th e Be g i n n i n g , Th e r e  w a s TILT 
 In 1997, the University of Texas at Austin began work on 
the Texas Information Literacy Tutorial  (TILT ).  The tutorial “was 
designed for use at all sixteen component institutions: to ensure 
first-year students grasped basic research concepts, to best utilize 
librarians’ expertise when in the classroom, and to provide basic 
information literacy skills accessible anytime and anywhere.”1  In 
three modules, TILT  covered selecting appropriate information 
sources, effectively searching library catalogs and databases, and 
evaluating and citing information.  Each module contained a game 
or online search component and was followed by a quiz.   
 The creators of TILT  made the entire tutorial available 
for downloading through an Open Publication License (OPL).  
An OPL lets the signer use TILT  material as long as it is properly 
credited; any future adaptations based on TILT ’s content must also 
be released via an OPL.  This innovation sparked a swarm of local 
customizations, including UE’s I*Trail (now offline).
 Another institution that took advantage of TILT ’s OPL was 
Western Michigan University (WMU).  They created Searchpath  
in 2001 and made it available through an OPL in 2002.  Some 
of WMU’s modifications included breaking TILT ’s three modules 
into six, removing the frameset, adding more Flash animations, 
and deleting the non-Flash tutorial version. 
 TILT  and Searchpath  begat inflite , a third-generation 
information literacy tutorial developed at Indiana University-Purdue 
University Indianapolis (IUPUI) in 2003.  The development team 
understood that research is a continuous process, with no single 
beginning or ending point.  They designed inflite ’s module selector 
to reflect this idea.  IUPUI added more Flash games and designed 
the quizzes to be accessible through Oncourse, the campus’ course 
management system.  inflite  was released via an OPL in 2003.

UE’s library, resources and branding.  Atwater-Singer also signed 
Searchpath ’s OPL in 2006 to incorporate WMU’s Flash animation 
describing information literacy.  To modify the tutorials, Atwater-
Singer used WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), low-
tech software, a few, key internet services, and the technical 
skills she has learned as UE Libraries webmaster.
de s i g n  ov e r TiMe
 When TILT  was in production, frames were the newest 
feature in web design.  Frames were developed by Netscape in 
1996 and were immensely popular—so popular that other browsers 
began to support their implementation.  The advantages of framing 
a website are uniformity of style, set navigation/menu choices and 
one unique web address (URL).  The disadvantages of framing 
are printing problems, unclear site structure, inability to bookmark 
pages, and one unique URL for an entire website.  When it debuted 
in 1998, TILT   had different framesets for the modules and quizzes.  
WMU removed TILT ’s modules from their framesets when it 
created Searchpath .  This eased printing problems, allowed users 
to bookmark key pages, and made distinct URLs possible.  inflite  
inherited a frameless Searchpath  and continued to use this platform 
to drive its development.
 The most daunting part of modifying any webpage was 
editing the coding.  TILT , Searchpath  and inflite  were all written 
in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which has been the 
internet standard.  HTML told the browser how to display the 
content of a webpage.  Since its standardization in 1995, HTML has 
evolved into XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language), 
separating the content of a page from how it was displayed by 
the browser.  This separation allowed for greater flexibility and 
accessibility for all web surfing devices.  For example, if one 
authored a page once in XHMTL, it could be read by PCs, tablets, 
PDAs, cell phones, aural devices, etc.  If one authored the same 
page in HTML, it would need different versions for each device or 
risk having some content not display.  
 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) partner with XHTML to 
tell browsers how to display a web page’s content.  Once all of the 
font tags were deleted, Atwater-Singer used one CSS file to define 
how the entire tutorial was styled.  For example, every page has its 
title tagged with a <h1>.  This heading tag was then styled to be a 
certain color, font, size and alignment (left or center).  When the 
webpage was linked to the CSS file, the styles were displayed as 
coded.  This was an incredible time saver because if one wanted 
to change the color of the <h1> tag, one just had to edit one CSS 
file, not all 1,000 files of inflite .  Atwater-Singer also validated the 
XHTML via the World Wide Web Consortium’s service ( http://
validator.w3.org /) for compliance and to spot errors within the 
coding.    Using high-tech skills and low-tech software, Atwater-
Singer’s customization of inflite  was documented on a webpage 
called How did they do that?3   Details of directories and pages 
that were edited and the changes made were listed there.  Using 
this webpage as a guide, one could easily modify inflite  for his/her 
institution.aC Ce s s i BiLiT Y a n d Us aBiLiT Y
 Two very important considerations for web developers 
are the accessibility and usability of a website.  Accessibility refers 
to a web page’s content being available to everyone, especially 
people with disabilities.  For example, if a page is styled in a ten-
point font, someone with impaired vision will be unable to read 
the content.  Accessible text is not expressed as a specific point 
size, but rather is styled as a percentage of the browser’s default 
font size, which allows for scaling.  Also, by offering non-Flash 
versions of key pages,  inflite  has made accommodations to users 
with slower internet connections.
 Usability refers to how easy a website’s design is to 
use, especially in regard to finding information or completing a 
task.  A usability study helps the designer identify where users 
have problems with the interface (including the desire to leave the 
site completely), and how efficiently they can find information. 
Jakob Nielsen recommends that a usability study should have five 
users complete a series of exercises that represent common tasks.2   
There have been no published studies testing the usability of TILT , 
Searchpath  or inflite .
Br e e Ze a n d Ca pTi v aTe
 Working from another perspective, using user-friendly 
high-tech software  such as Breeze and Captivate (freely available 
on a trial basis), Metcalf created simple online tutorials in a few 
weeks. While Atwater-Singer serves as her library’s webmaster, 
how might an instructional services librarian create equally 
dynamic online tutorials without HTML expertise? What follows 
is one librarian’s experience using Breeze Presenter out of the box 
and with minimal training.         
 Breeze Presenter4 is a Microsoft PowerPoint plug-in 
that works to  create rich media online presentations with audio 
narration. One simply creates a set of slides and, from the Breeze 
menu embedded in PowerPoint, records audio for each slide, and 
then “publishes” to either the hard-drive, a CD or the online Breeze 
Server. Once published to the Breeze Server, a URL is provided as 
a direct link to the online tutorial. Using Adobe’s Captivate5 one 
can create interactive content by capturing screen shots of every 
mouse click made while simultaneously narrating the steps for the 
viewer. For example, this software enables one to create “live” video 
demonstrations of how to search a database or an online catalog.      
re s e a r Ch roL Le r Co a s Te r s
 The content and design of Pennsylvania State University’s 
video tutorial The Information Cycle6 was used to measure the 
success of employing the more user-friendly Breeze Presenter in 
place of Adobe’s more sophisticated and expensive Flash, Fireworks 
and Dreamweaver. The Information Cycle  was produced in 1999 and 
used the Columbine High School massacre to illustrate the different 
types of information that are generated over time by a single event. 
Using PowerPoint and Breeze, Metcalf created a 3-minute video 
Lo e x-2006    61 -Th e Be g e T Ti n g o f in f o r MaTi o n LiTe r a C Y TU To r i a Ls:...-titled Research Roller Coasters , patterned after The Information 
Cycle , but updating the research topic to  Hurricane Katrina.
 How did Research Roller Coasters  stand-up against 
The Information Cycle ? Two content developers, one designer 
and one programmer were involved in the six-month project to 
produce The Information Cycle . Standing on their shoulders and 
borrowing from their basic idea, Metcalf was able to create a less 
sophisticated but similar video in about three weeks’ time. While 
The Information Cycle  is impressive, it is nine minutes long and 
some find the Columbine topic outdated . Research Roller Coasters 
was designed with user-friendly software, limited technical 
expertise and staffing, and was intended to be much shorter and 
adaptable. The PowerPoint slides were designed to facilitate 
updating the tutorial in less than an hour from Katrina to a different 
topic. Showing Research Roller Coasters  as a short tutorial in the 
beginning of a fifty-minute library instruction session uses less 
time and affords a segue into class specific resources.  Several 
faculty have been willing to show The Information Cycle  prior to 
coming to the library for instruction.  There are plans to continue 
to promote this practice, but it would be beneficial to have a 
shorter option available for in-class and online use. 
 For those interested in experimenting with Breeze, four 
basic features of the software are discussed below: recording 
audio, publishing to the Breeze Server, creating and inserting 
Flash video, and creating a simple quiz. 
reCo r d i n g  aUd i o i n Br e e Ze
 Recording audio over PowerPoint slides is easy. If one 
makes a mistake, one can instantly re-record over one or more 
slides. If one adds notes to the PowerPoint slide note field, these 
notes can be imported into the Breeze audio record interface to 
serve as a script. It is recommended that one use a high quality 
microphone. Using the same microphone, audio quality repeatedly 
sounded better on a desktop than on a laptop.
 
pU B L i s h i n g  Br e e Ze
 After one has recorded the desired audio, go to the 
Breeze menu option in the PowerPoint menu bar (which shows up 
when Breeze is installed on the computer) and select the Publish 
option. Breeze instantly converts the PowerPoint file to a .swf 
Flash file and stores it by default on the computer’s hard-drive,

 When is Breeze not a breeze? Breeze proved to be user-
friendly until it came to inserting video created with Microsoft 
Movie Maker. This video clip is different from the “live” video 
demonstrations made with Captivate as discussed previously. A video of a roller coaster interspersed with still shots of students 
involved in the research process was easily created using 
Microsoft Movie Maker.  While converting this video from .wmv 
to .swf proved easy enough with conversion software, inserting 
the resulting Flash file proved repeatedly unsuccessful.
 Problems inserting the Flash video included continuous 
video looping, the reordering of PowerPoint slides in the slide 
sorter, and the video did not reset itself back to the beginning 
unless the file was closed and then reopened.  When switching 
from Turbine Video Encoder 2.07 to Sorenson Squeeze8 for 
conversion, some of the previous problems were solved but 
others were created.  A white box would appear in the video 
slide after one viewing, and the presentation would have to be 
closed and reopened. While the repeating looping of the Flash 
video was later solved by selecting the video’s properties and 
changing Loop true  to Loop false , the problems were far from 
solved. A frequent error message that appeared, only when 
specifically trying to insert a converted Flash video, was “…
Breeze Presenter cannot load the recordings for all files. The 
recordings are not in the .ppc file.”  
 Campus IT Services is currently in contact with Adobe 
Breeze to resolve these problems. Since the roller coaster video 
was created in Microsoft Movie Maker and then converted into 
Flash, there might be fewer problems if one started with Flash.   
However, Flash is a complex program and the point of this 
project was to employ user-friendly software. Microsoft Movie 
Maker, which is bundled with Microsoft Office, was readily 
available and simple to learn. At this time, the fifteen-second 
roller coaster will be used for in-class presentations only until 
the technical difficulties of embedding this type of Flash video 
in Breeze can be solved.  
Cr e a Ti n g QUiZ Ze s
 Finally, one can readily create online quizzes in Breeze. 
There are several question types: multiple choice, true/false, 
fill-in-the-blank, matching, Likert, etc.  At this time, quiz 
results cannot be emailed. For faculty who use a course content 
management system such as Blackboard, it is recommended that 
tutorial quizzes be produced in Blackboard, not Breeze. However, 
since librarians do not use Blackboard or grade student work, 
Breeze quizzes could be used by students as a self-evaluation.
Co nC L U s i o n
 Librarians with high- or low-tech skills can readily 
benefit from the information literacy tutorials described in 
this article.  The building-blocks are available for free, either 
through open publication licenses or downloadable online trials.  
Metcalf and Atwater-Singer recommend a combination of skill, 
software, patience, confidence and bravado when crafting online 
information literacy tutorials for the iPod generation.

 What is the right space for library instruction?   How do we 
propose a project of that magnitude?   What happens if the architect 
doesn’t listen to us?   Can we do this on our own, without an architect?  
Do we want fixed seating?  What type of equipment is needed?  What 
should the capacity be?  These and other questions need to be addressed 
in the need to create dedicated instructional spaces within or near a 
library.   With the increasing demand for electronic classrooms and the 
measurable benefits smart classrooms have in effective information 
literacy instruction, librarians are being asked to provide improved 
learning environment for their students.   This presentation will illustrate 
prototypes for shaping learning spaces to respond to changing learning 
needs.   The result will be a set of practical guidelines for managing 
design and construction projects of this type.
de v e Lo p i n g  a pr o p o s a L
 A strong proposal to those who make decisions on capital 
improvement projects can result in approval for a good idea and, 
in addition, make the difference between inadequate and adequate 
funding.  After presenting the guiding rationale for the project, the 
proposal should outline the benefits of designing and constructing the 
new space:  users should be identified, as should the planning group.  
This group should involve all who need to play a role, such as a sampling 
of students and faculty, information technologists who will supervise 
computer equipment and networks, physical plant personnel, who may 
employ standards for equipment replacement, such as lamps and other 
consumables.  Identification of the client or clients is essential.  Whom 
will the architect or contractor report to?  Whose approval is needed for 
the design to move into construction?  Whose approval is needed for changes or for additional funds?
Th e pr o g r a M
 Often overlooked is the design or architectural program, 
which is essential for reaching an understanding of and agreement 
on the scope and parameters of the project.  Beginning with the 
overarching goals for the project, the program is a list of its functional 
requirements.  Not a recommended solution, it is rather a statement 
of the problem.  Rather than qualifying the problem, it quantifies it 
by providing numbers of users, square footages, and other specific 
requirements.
Be n e f i Ts o f a n inTe r i o r  arCh iTeC T
 Although the final cost of the project will be greater—perhaps 
as much as 15% higher—there are benefits to employing an interior 
architect.  The architect or designer may ask key questions the client 
may not think of.  The architect will also coordinate the construction 
schedule, based on knowledge of the optimal sequence of construction 
components, such as electricity, structure, or carpentry.  The architect 
or designer will also supervise construction and identify problems or 
omissions on the part of the contractor(s).  Experienced not only in 
providing accurate cost estimates, these practitioners are also familiar 
with sources for equipment and materials and may be able to acquire 
more durable and attractive furnishings than those available through 
standard library suppliers.  Finally, the design practitioner can develop 
specifications for equipment and materials, insuring that the proper 
selections are made from an often endless set of options.
sp aCe in v e n To rY
 Although in many cases there will be a specific space 
available for the project, in some environments, there may be 
several options from which to choose.  All potential spaces for the wh o pU T Th aT CoL U M n i nTo Th e Mi d dLe o f Th e ro oM?:

spaces, their features should be listed:  square footage; geometry; 
structural and spatial intrusions, such as columns and doors; 
natural and artificial lighting; ceiling heights; level of heating, 
ventilating, and air conditioning (HV AC); condition of surfaces 
(floors, ceilings, walls).  The interior architect will be a resource 
for identifying the space that best matches the program.
es s e n Ti aL CoMp o n e n Ts o f Th e sMa rT CLa s s r o o M
 What is the smart, or intelligent, classroom?  It is a 
learning space equipped with electronic equipment giving all 
students access to technological resources, such as the Internet, 
course management software, an intranet, databases, and other 
electronic subscriptions.  It allows the instructor to communicate 
with students not only orally, but also by means of the technology.  
Its basic components are computer work stations for each student, 
a proctor station for the instructor, a digital projector, a video 
cassette recorder and player, a DVD player, a stereo receiver and 
speakers, a projection screen, storage for supplies, perhaps a multi-
media cart for portable systems, printers and printer stands, and 
that most atavistic of teaching tools, the white board.
Th r e e  sp aTi aL pr oToT Yp e s
 The first and most familiar model is fixed seating in rows.  
If this is your option, be sure to allow adequate space between rows 
for easy passage by the instructor.  The second option, and one 
recommended by many library instructors, is flexible of clustered 
seating, which allows students to work in smaller groups and which 
may facilitate discussion; this formation may be achieved through 
selecting trapezoidal tables on wheels.  The third option is stadium 
seating; the advantages of this option are better sight lines for 
students; be sure to insure adequate space between rows here, too, 
and remember that ADA compliance prohibits stairs.  In this option 
a work station at the entry level of the classroom will be necessary 
and will bring with it the liability of separating the student who 
uses it from the remainder of the class.  In some smart classroom, 
rows of students face each other; this is not recommended since 
some students will always have their backs to the instructor.
wh iTe Bo a r d s
 These are, of course, the descendents of dusty and trusty 
chalk boards.  Their relative cleanliness necessitates dry-erase 
markers and the occasional use of a cleaner-solvent.  Since the 
instructor may well need the white board and the projection screen 
at the same time, the white board should not be, as it often is, 
located behind the projection screen.  You may wish to consider 
interactive white boards, which energize presentations with touch-
sensitive displays and note-making with digital ink.  There are 
three types of projection manufactured by SMART Technologies:  
font, rear, and flat-panel.  There are assets and liabilities to these 
types of screens:  although they allow the instructor to leave the 
lectern and emphasize teaching material in front of the class at 
the screen, these screens may be relatively small.  The alternative, also manufactured by SMART Technologies, is the Sympodium 
interactive pen display, which connects to the computer directly 
and, with an attached pen, allows the instructor simply to touch the 
monitor for applications and note-making.  It employs the standard 
projection screen, which can be larger than that of the SMART 
Board, but impedes movement by the instructor by fixing activity 
to the lectern.
LeC Te r n
 The location of the lectern should be considered carefully.  
If it is not to block the projection screen, it will be positioned toward 
the side of the room, causing considerable movement between 
lectern and projection screen.  Some prefer to locate the lectern at 
the center of the classroom; this may block sight lines as well, but 
it does place the instructor at the center.  Many lecterns contain 
touch screens that control all of the equipment; many also feature 
awkward designs with insufficient space for notes, keyboard 
drawers that cannot be fixed and that require uncomfortable hand 
positions.  Some instructors prefer a wireless mouse and a portable 
keyboard.
CLa s s r o o M Ma n a g e Me nT so fTw a r e
 Also known as classroom control systems, these are 
essential tools for teaching in smart classrooms.  They allow 
instructors to control the hands-on experience by broadcasting 
information to individual work stations or to the entire class.  As 
OPAC and database text on projection screens may be difficult to 
read, these tools bring the presentation to each computer.  Some 
allow for access to the individual student’s work station to see 
who is having difficulty.  Perhaps most useful is their fundamental 
disciplinary capability of preventing “off-task” activity when a 
presentation occurs.  Some available systems are Apple Remote 
Desktop, AristoClass, InSight and Catapult, KnowledgeWEB 
System, LanSchool, SoftLink, NetOp School, NetSupport School, 
Sanako Study, and SmartClass.
Li g h Ti n g
 Whether natural or artificial, the quality of light has 
a perceptible impact on the experience of space.  There are two 
kinds of light:  ambient, which provides general, or mood, lighting, 
and task lighting, applied to specific activities.  Optimally, the light 
will be adequate for the task without adding glare, and the pattern 
of lamps will follow the pattern of activities.  The interior architect 
should provide a reflected ceiling plan, which is the inverse of a 
floor plan; rather than looking down, the viewer looks up.  You 
should match the ceiling plan to the floor plan to determine whether 
the lighting has been positioned correctly.  Don’t forget to check 
the placement of light switches, especially if you are inheriting a 
space used for other purposes.  They should be positioned at each 
entry, as well as near the lectern.  Rheostatic controls for lights are 
helpful, as are separate controls for ambient and task lighting.

 Unless you are willing to rely on battery-powered 
computers, which require ongoing maintenance, you will need to 
install power outlets within reach of each work station.  Customized 
furnishings for work stations often integrate power outlets within 
their designs, placing them on the table top.  Usually, power 
outlets and data jacks are combined into one unit.  Don’t forget 
that printers will need sources of power as well.
he aTi n g, ve nTiLaTi n g, a n d ai r Co n d i Ti o n i n g
 Most spaces designed before the digital era were designed 
for lower heat loads.  Be aware that computer equipment adds 
measurably to the heat load of the space and that ventilating and 
air conditioning will need to respond to those loads.  The project 
may well require adding a compressor or duct work, which will 
add to the scope and expense of the project.
TYp e s o f wo rK sTaTi o n s
 There are arguments in favor or both desktop computers and 
laptop computers.  The advantages of desktop computers include their 
modularity, so that, if a keyboard wears out or has coffee spilled onto 
it, only that component need be repaired or replaced.  Lower prices also 
contribute to the argument in their favor.  The chief argument against 
them is the amount of area they consume, in addition to the size and 
height of obtrusive monitors, which can block visual communication 
between students and the instructor.  Retractable monitors can provide 
a solution.  Those who prefer laptop computers mention their smaller 
footprints, fewer cords, and opportunities they provide for reconfiguring 
the space.  If a classroom control system is unavailable, the lids of 
the laptops can be closed to focus attention onto the projection screen.  
The arguments against them include reliance on batteries that will limit 
the duration of their use, and the concern that limited battery life may 
require unanticipated expenditures.  Internal mice may be unfamiliar 
to some users, and laptop computers may require a non-standard desk 
height so as to position the keyboard at the proper level, which may at 
the same time lower the monitor to a level that makes them difficult 
for some to read.  Furnishings should therefore be designed or selected 
with great care in relation to ergonomics.  The Occupational Safety & 
Health Administration of the U. S. Department of Labor has a helpful 
purchasing guide checklist.
Ma i nTe n a n Ce
 Cooperation from technology services for the maintenance 
of the computer equipment, in addition to housekeeping for the 
space, is often omitted from the planning equation.  New spaces 
require additional assignments or personnel.  Be sure to enroll 
managers of those areas in the planning process from the start.
Co nC L U s i o n
 Increasingly, library administrators are engaged in 
space planning and design.   This uncharted territory can yield unanticipated results, both satisfying and problematic.  They key 
is to gather as much information as possible in advance, to work 
with the best practitioners possible, and to allow at least twice as 
much time as you would ever imagine needing.

 Following guidelines in the Association of College and 
Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards 
for Higher Education, librarians at the University of North Texas 
have dedicated themselves to integrating library instruction 
into the curriculum, with the goal of establishing the roots of 
information literacy at the freshman level. We believe we are 
laying the foundation for life-long learning by teaching within the 
curriculum, setting the stage for student-centered learning, and 
providing technology competency. But are we?
 To ensure we are meeting this goal, we developed a 
strategy of assessment that includes pre-testing (at the beginning 
of a library instruction session), post-testing (at the end of a library 
instruction session), and post post-testing (testing at the end of 
the semester). We test our students using in-house- designed web-
based software. This software requires students to perform the 
library skills taught in library instruction sessions, allows them to 
make comments, and gauges their comfort level in approaching 
librarians for help. Our assessment is unique; it takes advantage 
of new testing technologies to truly learn about students’ library 
technology competence. Instead of reporting what they think they 
know students are actually performing the skills taught. This is 
essential because “…increasingly, information technology skills are 
interwoven with, and support, information literacy” (Association of 
College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency 
Standards).
BaC Kg r o Un d
 At the University of North Texas, the required freshmen English classes have a standardized syllabus. As the culmination 
of their second semester of English composition, the students 
must complete a research paper assignment. Never one to let an 
opportunity pass us by, we seized the research paper assignment 
as an opportunity to not only  teach the necessary library skills 
for the research paper assignment, but also to make certain 
that the library skills related to the ACRL Information Literacy 
Competency Standards. We asked to have a library orientation as 
part of the standardized syllabus for the freshman English classes. 
Once the library orientation was on the standardized syllabus, we 
had to decide what library skills the students needed in order to be 
successful in completing their research paper assignment.  Our goal 
was to make the curriculum demands of the class a seamless match 
with the ACRL Information Literacy Standards and luckily, the 
basic steps of research for a paper fit nicely within these standards  
 We determined that there were four basic tasks we needed to 
accomplish to help the English 1320 students successfully complete 
their research paper and lay the foundation for information literacy 
competency.  The four tasks we pinpointed were: 1) overcoming 
library anxiety; 2) being able to find and ask for help; 3) the ability 
to find and access materials in the online catalog, and 4) the ability 
to find and access materials using Academic Search Premier. As 
a result, we have regular library instruction sessions and teach 
ACRL Information Literacy skills within our curriculum.
as s e s s Me nT re a r s iTs UgL Y he a d
 Problem solved, right? If only it were that easy. For a 
while we were satisfied. We had about 80 library instruction 
sessions for the English freshman class each year, and considered 
our work with the English department a great success. Then we 
began to wonder: How do we know that the students are learning 
the information literacy skills that we are trying to teach them?  In 
the past, most libraries have used paper surveys and tests, many as s e s s i n g  Th e foUn d a Ti o n: inCo r p o r a Ti n g as s o Ci aTi o n o f

started to expand their assessment much further to include tools 
such as Project Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy 
Skills (SAILS) and Information and Communication Technology 
Assessment (ICT). Both Project SAILS and ICT work to test 
institutional initiatives of information literacy skills. These tools, 
however, require a large amount of time for librarians to administer 
the tests and for the students to take the tests. And these large scale 
assessments do not meet the needs of librarians who only get to 
teach students one-shot instruction.
 Most of our students are going to come to the library for 
instruction one time in their entire college career. While we have 
a thriving instruction program at the UNT Libraries, we are also 
fairly representative of the reality of large universities. While we, 
as librarians, teach a lot of classes; the number of students that 
actually receive instruction is hit and miss. Our FTE is over 24,000 
students, and almost half of these students are transfer students. 
Our core curriculum is mostly made up of lists of elective choices 
rather than standardized classes that each student must take.  The 
exception to this is the freshmen English courses (English 1310 
and 1320), U.S. History, and Political Science.  With this situation, it can be difficult to develop a plan that targets all or the majority of 
students.  Our solution was to target the required English courses.  
 
in f o r MaTi o n aBoU T oUr saMpLe
 Nine hundred students attended a library instruction 
session for an English class in the fall of 2005. During the spring 
2006 semester; 1,475 students attended these sessions. A total of 
3,411 students attended one of the English course library instruction 
sessions held during the academic year. We administered the 
assessment in 48 classes.  The assessment was administered only 
in 90 minute class sessions because we did not want to lose five 
minutes of instruction time in the shorter 50 minute sessions. 
The majority our results were derived from the spring 2006. 
After assessing for two semesters, we ended up with 499 useable 
results.

 The assessment is completely anonymous and Institutional 
Review Board of Human Subject Testing approved. Here are the 
screen shots of our questions as the students see them:

 The majority of the students in the English classes are 
freshmen ages 18-20.  Their ability to answer these questions 
should give us some insight into the abilities of students who 
attend large mid-level universities such as UNT.
re sU L T s o f oUr LiBr a r Y in sTrU C T i o n as s e s s Me nT
Five questions will be discussed in relation to the results:  
1) How comfortable are students asking for help from a librarian?
 Since students will not walk into the library knowing 
everything about research, it is important to assess their willingness, 
and ability, to ask a librarian for assistance.  In the pretest, 40% of 
students were very willing to ask for help from a librarian; 30.72% 
were somewhat likely; 17.11% were neutral; 2.47% were not at all 
likely; and 9.69% had no response.  We believe one of the most 
important aspects of our instruction is presenting ourselves as 
friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful and even though the pre-test 
results were largely positive, we were hopeful that they would be 
even more likely to approach us after the instruction session.  We 
were pleased to find in the posttest that 57.11% were very likely 
to ask for help from a librarian; 27.84% were somewhat likely; 
7.63% were neutral; 0.21 were not at all likely; and 7.22% had no 
response.  These results represent a marked increase in students’ 
willingness to ask for help.2) What do students know in terms of basic library and technology 
skills when they first start college?
 According to our results, 68.04% of students were able to 
find the page on the library website that offers help from a librarian.  
Only 1.24% of the students were able to perform a subject search 
in the library catalog.  16.49% of students were able to perform a 
search in Academic Search Premier.
 These results were surprising to us.  We knew that students 
were struggling with using library resources prior to attending 
library instruction sessions, but how much they are struggling was 
a big eye opener.  Only 6 out of 499 students could successfully 
perform a subject search in the catalog.  It was shocking to discover 
that so few students could use the catalog!
 A student’s ability to perform these basic searches is an 
essential skill needed for  information literacy.  These skills are the 
basic foundational building blocks on which information literacy 
is built.  We know that the overwhelming majority of students use, 
and feel comfortable with, Google.  However, few students use 
and feel comfortable with the library catalog.  The problem is with 
the limited amount of time we get to teach students all of these 
information literacy concepts.
 
Lo e x-2006    103 -as s e s s i n g  Th e foUn d a Ti o n: inCo r p o r a Ti n g as s o Ci aTi o n o f CoL Le g e...- Within the limited instruction time we get, we must teach 
students the basics of searching and embed the importance of 
using library resources to increase the likelihood of finding quality 
information.  The shorter evaluation time for library resources 
is contrasted with the amount of time and knowledge needed to 
evaluate freely-available internet sources.
3) Do students understand some tools better than others?
 We wanted to understand this in terms of pre-instruction 
and post-instruction.  Our original hypothesis was that finding this 
out would point to whether our teaching methods were effective.  
Since beginning the study, we have expanded that interpretation to 
include the finding that some tools are much  harder for students to 
understand than others.
 After instruction, only 11.13% of students could perform a 
subject search in the catalog.  We found that 49.69% could perform 
a search in Academic Search Premier.  This represents a 9.89% increase in ability to search the catalog, and a 33.20% increase in 
ability to search Academic Search Premier.
 There is not a greater time spent covering Academic Search 
Premier than the catalog in the library instruction session.  One 
implication of our findings is that catalog may be far less intuitive 
than Academic Search Premier—a suspicion that multitudes of 
reference librarians have voiced in various forums throughout the 
country.
 An alarming discovery we made was that students actually 
decreased in their ability to find the Help page after the instruction. 
In the pretest, 68.04% found the Help page, while 58.56% found 
the Help page in the post test.  After reflection, we decided the 
reason for this may be that instead of showing students how to find 
the Help page directly from the Library Home page, we show them 
from another page titled  Library Services for UNT Off-Campus 
Users (see image below)
Wha t we
show  in class.
Wha t we
shou ld show .
 104    L o e x-2006   -gaY La BYe rL Y a n d  an n i e do w n e Y- We have learned that, for future sessions we should 
always go back to the Libraries Homepage and show them the Ask 
a Librarian link under the Help menu rather than showing them 
from another page.
 This finding points to the necessity of being very clear 
with students. This may seem obvious, but experts in any field tend 
to forget what it was like to be at the beginning stages of learning 
their specialty. Librarians are skilled at quickly scanning pages and 
finding bits of information.  Students, on the other hand, are still 
learning this skill and can be easily confused when delving into 
websites.
4) Are some students learning more, differently, or better than 
others?
One of the variables we are examining is gender.  186 of the 
students assessed were female; 122 were male; 177 did not say.  
See table below:
Pre-test 
CatalogPost-test 
CatalogTotal 
Increase
Female 1.6% 11.8% 10.2%
Male 1.6% 8.1% 6.5%
5) Are students retaining what we are teaching?
 In the post post-test, 7.8% were able to do a subject 
search in the catalog; 47.36% could successfully search 
Academic Search Premier; 73.7% could find the help page.  
This shows that students are retaining the skills they are 
learning in the library instruction session.
Co nC L U s i o n
 Many critics state that one-shot library instruction 
sessions are a waste of time and undermine true information 
literacy efforts.  We heartily disagree.  While we work to 
change the climate of many campuses to include information 
literacy offerings, we also must take into account the reality 
of the overwhelming majority of campuses.  As we have 
previously stated, the majority of library instruction sessions 
are one-shot.  This is the reality.  We have to do our best to 
reach our students within this framework.  Should we work to 
change the system? Yes, and we hope our research will go a 
little way towards helping librarians make their case that the 
system does indeed need changing.  But in the meantime, it is 
clear that every minute we get with students is fundamental 
to laying the foundation of their being able to use the library 
to complete their assignments effectively and to build up 
information literacy skills.fUrTh e r re s o UrCe s

 Students who begin their undergraduate studies at California 
State University, East Bay, enroll in a First Year general education 
cluster, consisting of disciplinary, oral communication, composition, 
critical thinking, and information literacy courses. These students 
must fulfill a two-credit, general education requirement in information 
literacy to receive the bachelor’s degree. Librarians at CSUEB teach 
ten to twelve sections of the two-credit Introduction to Information 
Literacy  course (LIBY 1210) in the First Year Cluster program each 
quarter.
 In 2003-04, separate events provided opportunities to examine 
the role of information literacy in the University Library’s mission 
through strategic planning; in CSUEB’s institutional mission through 
an accreditation self-study; and in the campus’ general education 
program. Information literacy curricula and assessment were central 
to both the Library’s strategic planning process and the preparation of 
the accreditation self-study. Concomitantly, the University increased 
the information literacy graduation requirement from one credit to 
two credits. The resulting redesign of course curricula, along with 
internal and external assessment imperatives, led the Library Faculty 
to develop a portfolio assessment process for LIBY 1210.
as s e s s Me nT Co nTe xT
 Assessment of student learning has been an integral part 
of CSUEB’s required credit course program since its inception. 
Anonymous pre/post-tests, based on either the CSU Information 
Literacy objectives or the ACRL Information Literacy Competency 
Standards , have been administered to students in each section of 
Introduction to Information Literacy  since 1998.1 The initial pre/post-test, modeled on others already in use in 
library instruction, was a simple true/false & item matching format. 
Early versions focused on the nuts and bolts of finding information 
and were often source or tool specific. Later tests were broader, and 
questions were modified, added or dropped in an effort to more fully 
address the ACRL Standards .2 The test is reviewed annually and 
underwent revisions in 2000, 2002, and 2004.
 Aggregate test scores have shown improvement each quarter, 
although pre/post scores and the percentage of improvement varies 
considerably (ranging from 4.5% to 12.9%). In general, the lower the 
aggregate pre-test score, the greater the percentage of improvement 
shown in the post-test. The pre/post tests provided some useful, 
general data which has been used in curricular design.
 This testing process cannot by itself provide a full picture of 
what students understand and know how to do. Such tests cannot capture 
students’ thought processes or their understanding of IL concepts in 
application. The pre/post test data lack significant detail needed to 
inform adjustments in curricula, instructional design and teaching 
methods. Currently the pre/post test is seen as a complementary tool 
used in conjunction with other assessment methods.
po rTf oLi o as s e s s Me nT
 Portfolio assessment was adopted by faculty participants as 
a means for instructors and students to compile and analyze student 
work. As portfolio parameters were designed by each instructor, faculty 
discussions centered on the utility of selective or comprehensive 
student portfolios. Although the project’s assessment consultant and 
the education literature stressed the benefits of selective portfolios, 
most participants assigned comprehensive portfolios containing all of 
a student’s work in the course.3 Some instructors felt that the process 
of compiling and reviewing all of the coursework helped students 
synthesize course curricula.
 Individual instructors made different assignments in each 
course section ranging from weekly homework using various library 
tools to twice weekly research journals detailing student research and as s e s s Me nT BUiLd s sTr o n g  pr o g r a Ms ei g h T waYs! iT’s go o d

parameters multiple times over the span of the project, adjusting the 
emphasis placed on various course components both in the classroom 
and in grading practice. In most cases this process led to significantly 
more student writing in the course, including reflective (e.g. My 
Usual Method of Research ) and/or analytical essay (e.g. Information 
and Political Power ) assignments, and research journals or learning 
diaries. Concomitantly, faculty relied less on multiple choice or fill-in-
the-blank assignments and quizzes.
 Over time, an effort emerged to have students articulate 
‘that they know what they know’ . This led some faculty to edit and 
distribute the portfolio rubric (see below) to students.4 Eventually most 
faculty assigned a culminating self-evaluation essay, to be written as 
the portfolio is prepared, wherein students describe their mastery of 
the course objectives and select pieces of work as evidence of their 
learning.
rU Br iC de s i g n
 Early in the project faculty participants met with the 
project consultant to design a common rubric for assessing student 
portfolios. As faculty discussed learning priorities for first year 
student information literacy, consensus emerged on two objectives 
drawn from the ACRL Standards  and LIBY 1210 course objectives. 
These were eventually described in a revised version of the rubric 
as ‘Develops and describes research processes and strategies’  and 
‘Appropriateness of information collected’ .
 As participants worked to apply and/or adapt the simple rubric 
to student portfolios, discussions centered around what information 
literate students should know and be able to do, how current teaching 
practices did or did not provide opportunities to evaluate what students 
were learning, and what evidence of student learning might look like.
in sTrU C T o r na r r a Ti v e s
 The narratives are drawn from faculty participants with 
diverse orientations to information literacy and preparation for 
teaching. Some chose to become educators and came to CSUEB with 
teaching experience, professional preparation, or both. Other faculty, 
who had some experience with library instruction, began working 
with information literacy curricula when the University adopted IL 
objectives and developed the general education credit course program. 
Most undertook the role of educator and an identity as ‘teaching 
faculty’ after some time in more traditional academic librarian roles.
 Faculty discussions, during the rubric development phase and 
beyond, often included the motivations for and purposes of teaching 
information literacy. Articulated pedagogical positions ranged from 
utopian to pragmatic mixed with a common concern for student and 
instructor engagement and satisfaction. While no faculty member 
expressed doubts about their expertise as librarians, in an atmosphere 
of collegial purpose and support, all disclosed concerns about being 
effective teachers in their courses.
 Library faculty met over several quarters to review student 
portfolios and to share and evaluate their experiences using the 
rubric. Faculty were asked to assess their experiences with the goal 
of modifying curricula for subsequent quarters. As part of this self-evaluation process, faculty wrote brief narratives describing multiple 
aspects of their experience with portfolio assessment. The narratives 
illustrate myriad changes in philosophy and methodology experienced 
by participants and the impact on multiple aspects of their teaching 
practice from classroom activities to grading.
na r r a Ti v e in s i g h Ts
Is the rubric working? Parts are... [I] think I need to map some of 
my assignments (at least in my head) to [the] specific outcomes I 
want the students to try to achieve .
 The quote above echoes a recurring theme in the instructors’ 
narratives – of whether their curricula allowed students to demonstrate 
the abilities articulated in the rubric. Another instructor felt that “the 
rubric caused me to try to explain to the student more clearly what 
I expected in the reflective essay  [self-evaluation]”.The process of 
applying the rubric to student work inspired a close examination 
of one’s own instructional design and teaching methods, helped 
instructors stay focused on the learning goals stated in syllabi, and 
prompted reflexive revision to align curricula with student learning 
objectives.
 Assessing student learning in application also emerged as 
a common theme in the instructor narratives. One instructor noted 
that while he did not consider himself a ‘ natural teacher’ , he found it 
necessary to develop active learning strategies to gain more insight into 
what students were actually learning. Many instructors began using 
more active learning and group assignments where students worked 
cooperatively with the mediation of the instructor. Instructors reported 
that students found this active learning approach more interesting as 
well.
 The instructors’ reflective self-assessment processes, 
developed over the course of the project are ongoing. In group 
discussion and informal conversation, themes from the project inform 
the practices of the library faculty in the first year program and 
throughout the department’s information literacy initiatives.
sT Ud e n T seLf-ev aL UaTi o n & f aC U L T Y  gr a d i n g  pr aC TiCe s
 Instructors used a broad range of grading practices, from 
allotting points to each assignment and calculating a summative 
total, to having students assign their own course grades based the 
portfolio and self-evaluation. In most cases changes in curriculum, 
instructional design, and assessment practices profoundly altered 
weighted assignment grading and methods of calculating the 
course grades.
 Some participants experienced tension balancing 
student self-evaluation and instructor assigned grades and were 
concerned about potential discrepancies between student and 
faculty assessments. Eventually it became clear that the student 
self-evaluation essay was a critical aspect of student performance 
in the course and as such was assessed by instructors and factored 
into the course grade. As with the other course components, 
the self-evaluation essay should reflect students’ mastery of the 
abilities expressed by the rubric. It became increasingly important 
that students articulate in their self-evaluation essays a direct link 
between the work in their portfolios and the rubric elements.
Lo e x-2006    107 -as s e s s Me nT BUiLd s sTr o n g  pr o g r a Ms ei g h T waYs!...- Ideally the rubric would clearly describe target 
performance of the course goals, be used by student and 
instructor alike to evaluate student learning, and (hopefully) 
these independent evaluations would ‘mesh’.  In effect, the rubric 
provided a much clearer means to evaluate the portfolio and 
determine the culminating course grade.
 Over time, some instructors eliminated course 
components which they determined distracted students from the 
self-evaluation process. Some assigned the portfolio and research 
project a larger portion of the course grade as these tasks more 
clearly demonstrated the skills developed by the course.

 This project strengthened CSUEB’s information literacy 
program by applying authentic assessment techniques to enhance 
student learning  and engaging participants in collaborative inquiry 
for faculty development ; which led to curricular renewal  in the 
first year IL program and contributes to program assessment  
efforts; which enhances information literacy articulation  across 
the curriculum, informs library strategic planning , and campus 
accreditation processes through the institutional self-study ; all 
of which have made it possible for the authors and participants to 
make this humble  contribution to the scholarship of teaching and 
learning  in our field.

mandated assessments of student learning outcomes.  This 
reflects the current push for accountability triggered by 
legislatures who represent a public that wants to see the 
best return on the tax dollar. The interesting part is that 
not all regional accrediting bodies are requiring the same 
level of documentation of student learning.  As a result, 
one challenge for librarians is to determine the assessment 
criteria appropriate for their university contexts.  Criteria can 
be defined in several ways—by the regional accreditors, by 
the professional accreditors, and by the institution. Boards of 
regents and institutions’ respective higher education systems 
may also mandate criteria.  The demands of multiple and 
sometimes conflicting bodies present formidable challenges 
to understand and assess learning. The regional accrediting 
commission formulates their criteria based on the definition 
of information literacy cited by the Association of College 
and Research Libraries’ standards for information literacy.  Ma n d a Te s
The emphasis of this article is collaboration and 
creation of tools to assess student learning outcomes to share 
with an institution’s regional accrediting body.  Overall, 
there are six regional accrediting commissions, which in 
total are responsible for accrediting 3500 higher education 
institutions.  The regional commissions are guided by 
the Council of Regional Accrediting Commissions.  Each 
regional commission is recognized by the Council for Higher 
Education Accreditation.  It is important to keep abreast of an 
institution’s respective regional commission as accreditation 
standards may change.  In creating the table below, the 
authors identified core standards, criteria, or requirements 
that may be relevant for assessment of student learning by 
individual regional accrediting bodies.  While comparing the 
regional commissions, the authors also noted that there were 
two regional commissions which published new standards 
recently, Middle States and New England (see Table 1).  Cr e a Ti n g av e n Ue s:  p a rTn e r s h i p s  i n a Ch a n g i n g  en v i r o n Me nT

determining the standards; there may be an assessment office on 
your campus to help orient you to standards. Some libraries may 
have assessment coordinators.  If your library does not have an 
assessment coordinator, there may be a campus representative who 
can help you to facilitate this process. If not, you may need to 
check with a regional accrediting office for guidance.  To learn 
more about assessment, you can read Regional Accreditation and 
Student Learning: Principles for Good Practices  (2003), a report 
from the Council of Regional Accrediting bodies that can be 
accessed via the Middle States website listed in the References 
section. 
as s e s s Me nT
In order to begin the information literacy skills 
assessment process, you will need to read the mission statements 
for your institution and for your library.  There should be themes 
in the university’s and library’s mission statements that tie in to 
ACRL’s Information Literacy Standards.  If applicable, read your 
institution’s learning goals. You can move on to review instruction 
session goals with the respective faculty member and develop 
instruction session goals for their classes that then can be written 
as session outcomes.  As you develop your outcomes, you can 
create a short survey which can be a pre-test and post-test format.  
To develop a better understanding of assessing student learning 
outcomes you may want to read Assessing Student Learning: A 
Common Sense Guide  by Suskie (2004). There are a multitude of 
resources available to help you formulate your student learning 
outcomes and then assess those outcomes. Additionally, you may 
want to consider setting a benchmark, such as 60% of the students 
passing a survey.  You may use national assessment initiatives to 
determine how your institution compares with your peer institutions 
or comparable institutions.
Assessment can be conducted at several different levels--
instructor, library, university and national testing. Most assessments 
are surveys conducted at the instructor, library, and/or university 
levels. National assessments include Project SAILS and The 
National Survey of Student Engagement, although both of these 
result in the institution paying a fee to participate. Mark and Boruff-
Jones (2003) discuss assessing students’ information literacy skills 
by analyzing the institutions’ results from the National Survey 
of Student Engagement (NSSE) and comparing them to their 
Carnegie peers. To learn more about the match between NSSE and 
your regional accrediting body, see the accreditation tool-kit at the 
website for the National Survey of Student Engagement.
Emphasis on assessing students’ information literacy 
skills has increased the workloads of and demands on librarians 
and faculty. Thompson (2002) notes the shift in the work that we 
do from not only teaching students how to locate materials but also assessing information literacy skills.  Thompson’s conclusion 
stresses that “collaboration is the key to information literacy” (p. 
236). As a result, it is critical to develop partnerships so faculty and 
librarians can work together to determine and assess information 
literacy skills. The caveat is to work smarter, not harder, with the 
tools that you already have available. 
To be effective, Suskie (2004) states that assessment 
needs to be a continuous cycle with four steps:
• Establish learning goals
• Provide learning opportunities
• Assess student learning
• Use the results
Assessment results are often shared with university 
committees. At Frostburg State University, the results are shared 
with the Student Learning Advisory Group, the Institutional 
Assessment Committee, Deans’ Council, and the President’s 
Cabinet, as well as with faculty and library faculty instructors.  
The results are also shared with the Middle States Commission 
on Higher Education and other external bodies.  The Lewis J. Ort 
Library is mandated to report assessment activities as outlined in 
the academic program assessments, since all academic programs 
are required to report progress at regular intervals.
Librarians needed to develop a set of common Information 
Literacy Learning Goals. Once we determined the Library’s 
learning goals, we were able to establish a common survey to 
assess the Orientation students at the end of their first semester 
when the students took their final exam. Then we shifted the point 
of first-year library instruction to the Freshman Composition 
sections and conducted an assessment survey there. As this was 
a new development, there was a need to reach out and collaborate 
with faculty.  
pa rTn e r s h i p s
The key to collaboration is open mindedness in order to 
understand learning outcomes and to agree on assessment types.  
Building rapport helps the buy-in process.  Faculty who are really 
afraid of change may put up extra resistance.  The goal is not to 
make this process harder, but to take a practical approach.
At Frostburg, librarians ask faculty to accompany students 
to instruction sessions.  Some faculty may bring their students to 
the library sessions without an assignment, although if this occurs, 
the librarian may create an assignment which can be in the form 
of research exercises and guided practice questions (formative, 
direct) to help raise students’ levels of concern and attention.  Also, 
the assignment helps to reinforce the learning concepts introduced 
at the instruction session. See Table 2 for different types of 
assessment tools you could use during or after library instruction. 
 112    L o e x-2006   -Ka t h e r i n e  Je nKi n s a n d Ju d i t h  Pu l a-Judy scheduled a library instruction session for her 
freshman composition students for the first time in several years 
because the university undergraduate education initiative mandated 
that she should.  She wanted to get going with it as soon as she 
realized she had no choice in whether to do it, so she wanted to 
influence the process of what and how it was accomplished.  
Kate strove to meet Judy’s expectations without making 
extra work for Judy.  Before conducting Judy’s first library 
instruction class, Kate took Judy to lunch to discuss her vision 
of what the session should accomplish.  Kate then drafted an 
outline of the session and session handouts and sent them to Judy 
for feedback.  They exchanged several rounds of feedback, then 
settled on the handouts to give students. 
fi n d i n g s : Ti p s a n d Le s s o n s  Le a r n e d
Be aware that change is not going to happen overnight. 
Start with small steps. Review ACRL’s Information Literacy 
webpage.   Create an assessment binder to compile everything.  
If you are working at a large institution, consider assessing by 
sample size, as it is not possible to assess all students.  If you have 
time, participate in an e-seminar to sharpen your assessment skills.  
To learn about additional resources that exist for assessment, 
read Mark’s (2004) article entitled “Assessing Student Learning: 
Available Resources.” Also, for librarians and faculty to continually 
learn from colleagues, consider joining listservs such as tlt-swg , 
ili, or assess  to keep abreast of the latest information.  Another 
tip if you are working at a large university where it may be more 
difficult to reach out to faculty:   consider updating your scheduling 
library session page to request a syllabus attachment and a list of 
session goals and library assignment if applicable.
The need is critical to collaborate with faculty in greater 
numbers.  The hard part is that it is time intensive to develop and 
collaborate with faculty as they have many demands on their time. 
It is important to realize that the collaborative process takes time 
and to allow the time needed. Three keys to success are to develop 
and assess in small parts, to share the library’s vision with faculty, 
and to find ways to let faculty share their vision with library staf f.
 
 Another tip is to take advantage of assessment data that 
has already been collected as part of national assessment initiatives, 
such as the National Survey of Student Engagement.  These are 
standardized questionnaires designed to assess student engagement, given to freshman and seniors. If your institution participates in 
the National Survey of Student Engagement, you may want to 
consider analyzing or tying in those results to information literacy.  
This provides additional documentation beyond what librarians 
and faculty may already be collecting at the library level. 
For example, our in-house survey results at Frostburg 
State were used to differentiate content from the orientation 
session to the library and the Freshman Composition session.  
Additionally, we were asked to offer sessions on plagiarism.  At 
students’ request, Kate and Judy developed a handout of advanced 
tips for using Microsoft Word.
sUg g e s Ti o n s f o r fUrTh e r re s e a r Ch
For FSU librarians and collaborating faculty, we 
may want to consider conducting a longitudinal study of the 
Freshmen Composition survey results to see if we find that there 
is a significant increase in students’ information literacy skills as 
a result of library instruction. In general, with regard to the six 
regional commissions, one could conduct a study of the sample 
of institutions from each of the regional commissions to see what 
their assessment experience has been in the last five years.

During the 2005-2006 academic year, the University 
of University–Madison’s Memorial Library experimented with 
online survey software in classroom library instruction. We used 
the software to supplant most of our paper assessment tools and we 
experimented extensively with a different type of assessment tool, 
the knowledge survey. Knowledge surveys ask students to rate their 
readiness to be tested on a particular learning outcome without 
asking them to perform the task directly. We will discuss the use 
of online survey software in general and the various advantages to 
using this software. Finally, we will discuss in greater detail our 
experiments and preliminary data related to the knowledge survey 
tool.  For this discussion, the term “survey” is used to refer to 
any mechanism by which to receive feedback, including comment 
cards, evaluations, and in-class worksheets.
onLi n e sUr v e Y so fTw a r e
For the software, Memorial Library chose to use 
WebSurvey, a product developed by the Division of Information 
Technology (DoIT) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and 
only available to the faculty and staff at UW–Madison. However, 
we did examine other commercial products, such as SurveyMonkey, 
Zoomerang, and Survey Solutions Express, and found their feature 
lists and capabilities consistent with WebSurvey. 
The technical components of creating a survey are only 
slightly more complicated then creating a comparable paper version. 
There are essentially four steps in creating a survey using any of the 
mentioned survey products. First, give a name to your new survey. 
Second, begin to add or edit questions to the survey; all of the 
software provides avenues for multiple choice, true-false, rating 
scales, and open-ended questions. Also, many software packages 
provide a means of customizing the look of your survey by either allowing HTML coding within pages or questions, or by providing 
templates. At Memorial Library, we added screen capture images 
to some questions in order to provide contextualization. The third 
step is to deploy the survey as a static URL link. The final step is to 
analyze your results. Within the software, most products provide 
not only a means of collating the data, but representing it visually 
using charts and graphs. 
ad v a n Ta g e s
Because of its functionality, the online survey software 
can be used as a low-cost alternative to personal response systems, 
or clickers, and the advantages are parallel.  First, the software 
encourages all students to engage with materials by demanding 
that they interact with the session’s content. It also encourages full 
participation in activities and diminishes individuals’ tendencies to 
defer to more active learners in the class. Our classes were small 
enough that students were able to individually take surveys, which 
created a built-in time during the session for students to process 
content without interference from instructors. As another advantage, 
the anonymity of the surveys provides a safe environment for 
students’ input without the threat of public conflict.  We believe the 
surveys we administered were an accurate reflection of a class’s 
overall aptitude, ability, and opinion. Therefore, we experimented 
with tailoring sessions on-the-fly to students’ knowledge and desires 
as  the survey results unfolded. This meant that often our structures 
and outlines for a session were tentative and depended upon our 
surveys as blueprints for parts of the session. The functionality 
of visually representing data in charts and graphs allowed us to 
present the results to classes while they were still in progress, 
allowing us to create “teaching moments” within a session.
For a Psychology 411 class during the fall semester, we 
mapped nine different activities and matched them to specific 
survey questions. Upon administering the survey at the beginning 
of class, we examined the results immediately and then proceeded 
to cover the most appropriate activities.  In theory, this meant that BaU Mg a r T a n d ha s s e Me r
University of Wisconsin-Madison
 116    L o e x-2006   -st e v e n  Ba u m g a r t  a n d el i z a Be t h ha s s e m e r -students would get the information they needed most and place 
them in the center role of choosing the content. In practice, it 
meant that librarians needed to work outside of comfort zones and 
in opposition to traditional working assumptions. For example, 
in the above class, we found that students were more concerned 
with evaluation, analysis, and the process of making accurate 
judgment calls regarding information, rather than the actual search 
techniques that we were more accustomed to teaching.
Beyond the classroom, there were also administrative 
advantages to using online survey software: it was easier to collect 
and tabulate data. We were able to emulate common worksheets 
online and capture the information, and with an in-class printer, still 
allow students to leave with their work in hand. Additionally, the 
intermediate step of converting data into an electronic format was 
already done for us. Even better, if the survey was mechanically 
scoreable, the results were tabulated immediately.
sUr v e Y ex aMpLe s
One final advantage was the shear versatility of the 
software to emulate all forms of paper feedback. This ranged from 
comment cards to our experimentation with knowledge surveys.   
One example of how we used the software was to replace comment 
cards we had students complete at the end of a session. Instead of 
distributing index cards, we directed students to a website with an 
embedded link to the same open-ended questions, and at the end 
of a session we asked students to fill out the website “survey.” 
For a second use, we emailed evaluation forms to teachers as a 
website link to assess their satisfaction with the library session.  
We also emulated in-class exercises or worksheets during sessions 
using the software. For example, we used it to develop open-ended 
short essay questions and had students complete the questions as 
part of a classroom activity.  As another in-class example, we also 
converted paper search strategy worksheets that helped students 
constructively build search statements. For a fourth type of use, 
we emulated personal response systems by asking questions that 
determined session content; in one class we simply asked whether 
students preferred us to cover the mechanics of searching or 
techniques for evaluating sources.  Finally, we used the online survey 
software to conduct pre- and post-testing of skills, knowledge, and 
confidence related to information literacy. Consequently, we began 
to experiment extensively with knowledge surveys, as opposed to 
more traditional, performance-based tests.
Kn o w Le d g e  sUr v e Ys
 
Knowledge surveys, developed by Edward Nuhfer and 
Delores Knipp (2003), are a pre- and post-class assessment tool 
based on self-efficacy theory, the idea that a student’s judgment 
of their own capabilities in a subject area will make it more likely 
that the student will perform at a higher level on tasks related to the 
subject. Therefore, the knowledge survey does not test concrete 
knowledge or performance, but indirectly measures student 
learning by evaluating confidence levels. Knowledge surveys are 
designed around learning outcomes, allowing instructors to create 
a comprehensive assessment that addresses all areas of expected  knowledge in a subject. The questions are often linked with Bloom’s 
Taxonomy (see Table 1), allowing granularity that addresses all 
levels of learning equally, although the nature of some disciplines 
may require a more disproportionate number of factual, analytical, 
or evaluative questions. Creating questions for a knowledge survey 
is simple because they can be the same questions instructors use 
to test performance; often survey questions come from old tests, 
quizzes, and homework assignments.
Table 1 (Bloom, 1984)
Bloom’s Taxonomy
Competence Verbs
Knowledge defines, identifies, recalls
Comprehension describes, discusses, explains
Application applies, demonstrates, uses
Analysis analyzes, compares, distinguishes
Synthesis constructs, creates, formulates
Evaluation assesses, evaluates, selects
Using knowledge surveys as an assessment tool has 
many advantages. Knowledge surveys are quick and easy to 
create, especially with the use of online survey software, which 
also allows instructors to quickly score and analyze results. The 
surveys are designed to indirectly evaluate student learning, 
serving as an immediate indicator of students’ strengths and 
weakness and allowing for a more tailored learning experience. 
They also serve as a blueprint for students, clearly laying out the 
competencies they are expected to learn from the class. Just as 
importantly, knowledge surveys serve as an assessment measure 
for teaching effectiveness. Because knowledge surveys rely on 
defining and teaching to learning outcomes, low confidence ratings 
may indicate that the material was not sufficiently covered during 
class time. This also speaks to the fact that knowledge surveys 
are more objective than other common assessment tools used for 
library instruction, such as the instructor evaluation or one-minute 
essays, which may not get at the heart of what students learned, but 
instead may address more subjective factors such as the teacher 
or the classroom conditions. Finally, knowledge surveys, when 
compared to performance testing, allow for instructors to more 
easily ask questions addressing the higher-order thinking skills, 
such as evaluation and synthesis, without a significant time strain 
on students or instructors.
Kn o w Le d g e  sUr v e Y en gLi s h 168 r e sU L T s
Beginning in the fall of 2005, Memorial Library tested 
knowledge surveys as an assessment tool for library instruction 
sessions. The nature of library instruction, with classes typically 
meeting once for 50 minutes, required the comprehensive design 
of the knowledge survey to be adapted. Library instruction 
sessions were designed with two to four learning outcomes, which 
were addressed during the session through lecture and hands-on 
activities. These learning outcomes were evaluated with knowledge 
surveys at both the beginning of class and the end of class in order 
to measure a student’s change in confidence levels following 
Lo e x-2006    117 -on l i n e  Kn o w l e d g e  su r v e y s ...-instruction. Questions were designed around Bloom’s Taxonomy 
to address both the lower-order skills, such as identifying call 
numbers or using journal databases, and the higher-order skills, 
such as formulating search strategies and analyzing search results. 
We also chose to test students on performance questions related 
to the learning outcomes in order to corroborate our knowledge 
survey data.
 
During the spring semester, the knowledge survey was 
administered to four library instruction sections of an English 
168 class (see Figure 1), for which students were working on 
a historical paper. The students were expected to walk away 
from the library instruction: (1) knowing the best journal 
databases for their topic; (2) understanding and using the online library catalog; (3) formulating effective search strategies; 
(4) understanding how to limit or expand searches; and (5) 
knowing where to begin their research. We addressed these 
learning outcomes through discussion as well as 20 minutes 
for the students to work hands-on researching their topic. The 
pre-evaluation asked five knowledge survey questions and five 
correlating performance questions, as well as two additional 
queries that would allow us to look at different subsets of our 
students: ‘Do you have your paper topic selected?’ and ‘Have 
you been through a library instruction session for another 
class, either this semester or in previous semesters?’ The post-
evaluation asked the same five knowledge survey questions, 
but a different set of five performance questions that addressed 
different aspects of the learning outcomes.

This is a knowledge survey, not a test. The purpose of this survey is to help examine your understanding of 
information sources and library services based on the expectations of the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
and the UW-Madison Libraries. 
Read each question carefully. Please do not actually answer these questions. Instead, rate your confidence 
to answer these questions with your present knowledge, using the scale below: 
Mark an “A”  if you feel confident that you can answer the question right now for graded test purposes.
Mark a “B”  if you can make an educated guess for the answer right now for graded test purposes.
Mark a “C”  if you are not confident that you could sufficiently answer the question right now for graded 
test purposes.

 118    L o e x-2006   -st e v e n  Ba u m g a r t  a n d el i z a Be t h ha s s e m e r -Results from the English 168 sample showed that during the 
pre-evaluation, students’ estimation of their skills were almost on par 
with their performance, with an average confidence level of 57.6% 
and an average performance level of 52.2%, a difference of 5.2% 
(see Figure 2). During the post-evaluation, students rated themselves 
extremely confident, averaging 93.6%, but their performance only 
averaged 62.4%, a difference of 31.2% (see Figure 3). These numbers 
indicate that while both confidence and performance have increased, 
students are over-confident following library instruction sessions. 
Data also indicates that students who had previous library instruction 
sessions perform better on the pre-evaluation, but are equal with their 
peers for the post-evaluation. Surprisingly, the students who had 
already had topics selected, who would have had more opportunity to 
apply the concepts learned during class, did not perform better in the 
post-evaluation than students who had no topic selected. 
 
It isn’t yet clear what these results mean. It may be the case 
that the difference in post-confidence and performance is an indicator 
of students’ lack of ability to apply knowledge to new situations. It 
could also be an error in the construction of the performance questions 
if the content wasn’t sufficiently covered during the library session. In either case, the knowledge survey data is useful because it still gives 
direction for the improvement of future sessions: focus on application 
and the transferability of knowledge.
Co nC L U s i o n
In conclusion, we found online survey software to be a 
dynamic alternative to paper assessment tools as well as a low-cost 
alternative to personal response systems. The software allowed us to 
engage students and encourage full-participation in the sessions, as well 
as giving us the opportunity to immediately assess students’ strengths 
and weaknesses and tailor classes on-the fly. Knowledge surveys are 
a quick and easy assessment tool that has allowed us to evaluate the 
divide between student competency and student confidence, which 
furthers our understanding of student learning in library instruction.  
We also found that by using knowledge surveys in conjunction with the 
survey software, we increased our ability to assess often un-assessable 
content, getting at the higher-order thinking skills. Our preliminary 
experiments with knowledge surveys and online survey software have 
opened the door to further investigations.

Plagiarism and other academic integrity violations might 
be viewed as yet another issue of concern to the whole university, 
but the responsibility of no single department or unit.  For 
Georgetown University librarians it proved to be an opportunity 
to combine forces with others on campus to reach students in a 
new way.
Founded in 1789, Georgetown University has a total 
enrollment of 13,652 of which 6,719 are undergraduates and 6,933 
are graduate students enrolled in the graduate, law and medical 
schools. As a Catholic and Jesuit institution, the University is 
committed to the education of the whole person  (cura personalis ).  
Thus, qualities of character are as important to the University as 
academic achievement.
For more than 20 years the Lauinger Library staff 
at Georgetown University has taught students about library 
resources through a tutorial taken during the first few weeks of 
the fall semester.  The tutorial provides a basic orientation to 
the library because there is no required class that has a library 
research instruction component for first-year students.  Students 
build on the knowledge gained in the tutorial through course-
related Library instruction.  Initially a print-based tour/tutorial, in 
1999 the Library initiated an online, self-paced version.  Students 
answered some questions online, but others they wrote on answer 
sheets that were checked by reference librarians.  Although each 
of the undergraduate schools at Georgetown “required” that their 
students complete the library tutorial, there was no easy way to 
enforce compliance, and about 70% of students completed it.
In recent years, the Georgetown University Honor System 
experienced an increase in honor system violations, especially 
plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration.  Reports in the literature 
on academic dishonesty suggest that Georgetown’s experience 
is not unique (Ercegovac & Richardson 2004, p. 306-7).  Many 
students insisted that their violations were inadvertent; they just didn’t realize what they were doing was wrong.  The University 
deans wanted to find a way to teach incoming students about 
academic integrity in a systematic way.  Thus the deans’ interest in 
promoting academic integrity dovetailed nicely with the library’s 
desire for all students to have a baseline of understanding about 
the library.  In 2003, the deans and the University Librarian, along 
with several other units on campus, began a collaboration that 
created a new, mandatory tutorial called  Joining the Conversation:  
Scholarly Research and Academic Integrity .  Students must 
complete the tutorial by a Fall semester deadline in order to be 
able to pre-register for Spring semester classes.
The tutorial introduces some of the research skills students 
need to complete assignments without falling victim to last-minute, 
unethical shortcuts.  At the same time the tutorial acquaints students 
with academic integrity issues such as plagiarism, unauthorized 
collaboration, re-using old work, and proper citation.  Students 
learn:
•  Finding, evaluating, and citing relevant, quality sources
•  Academic integrity as defined at Georgetown and about  
  the Honor System
•  Availability of research help
•  The idea that they are part of an ongoing scholarly   
  conversation.
The purpose of the tutorial, from the library perspective, 
was to reinforce the idea that library research skills, resources, 
and services would give students the tools necessary to be more 
effective researchers and thus avoid the pitfalls leading to academic 
dishonesty.    The library portion of the tutorial is meant as a 
foundation for additional instruction leading to greater information 
literacy.  Although there are many online library tutorials which 
address information literacy, as well as several tutorials that tackle 
plagiarism and academic dishonesty (Bowman 2004), Joining the 
Conversation  appears to be atypical because it combines the two.
An online tutorial can reach large numbers of students, is self-
paced, uses attractive technology for tech-savvy students, and JaCoBs a n d hUs s eY

Disadvantages include the heavy investment in development, both 
in cost and time.  Once the tutorial has been launched, it needs to 
be constantly updated and refreshed to keep up with changes in the 
library and to improve its effectiveness.
Our initial planning and development involved students 
and faculty from the Honor Council who helped us choose scenarios 
that show students grappling with academic integrity and library 
research problems.  Students from the Honor Council crafted the 
science scenario and contributed to writing other scenes.  In addition, 
students were the cast of characters.  G.U. professor James Slevin’s 
conception of research as participating in a scholarly conversation 
provided the inspiration for the structure of the tutorial.  Faculty also 
provided feedback throughout the process of development.
TU To r i a L or g a n i ZaTi o n
The tutorial is organized into four sections.
• Introduction and Pre-test
• Tutorial
• Post-test
• Conclusion and tip sheet
The first fifteen slides introduce the tutorial and include 
comments from nine faculty on student participation and 
responsibility in the scholarly conversation. This is followed by a 
self-assessment of six questions, randomized from a pool of sixteen, 
designed to gauge each student’s understanding of the issues to be 
covered in the tutorial.
The heart of the tutorial consists of scenarios showing 
Georgetown students involved in realistic situations, working on 
assignments in philosophy, international affairs, biology, English, 
and business, but most of their topics have to do with researching 
AIDS.  The characters are confronted with research problems and 
ethical issues, yet they learn how to cope with them.  Often they ask 
for help from librarians, writing center tutors, teaching assistants, 
and fellow students.  Although some characters are tempted to take 
unethical shortcuts, none does.
As students take the tutorial they follow the characters 
through scenarios and must correctly answer thirty questions to 
move forward.  Questions cover topics that have just been presented 
and are multiple choice, multiple answer, or true/false.  Feedback 
is given for both correct and incorrect answers.  Students who 
make an incorrect choice must answer the question again.  Both 
incorrect and correct answers receive a response that reinforces the 
points being made.  The tutorial tool allowed us to create a number 
of similarly worded questions, from which one question would be 
randomly selected. This helped prevent students from getting the 
same question sets.
Following the tutorial scenarios, students take a post-test 
consisting of twelve randomly- selected questions which review 
and reinforce the material.  As with the pre-test, students may get questions wrong and still move forward.  Both correct and incorrect 
responses generate feedback. A brief conclusion includes a tip sheet 
<http://www.library.georgetown.edu/tutorial/tipsheet.htm> that 
students may refer to later.
The tutorial was designed so that students may stop at any 
point and return to the tutorial where they last answered a question.  
Unfortunately, those taking the tutorial in Guest Mode must start 
again from the beginning if they stop mid-way.  (Guest Mode:

TeCh n o Lo gY Be h i n d  Th e TU To r i a L
A generic quiz tool called KeyQuiz was developed in-
house and employs the ColdFusion programming language to 
dynamically create the tutorial web pages using a SQL Server 2000 
database. It is integrated with other University enterprise systems 
for authentication and for recording the results.
ad v e r Ti s i n g  Th e TU To r i a L
First-year and transfer students learned about the mandatory 
tutorial requirement through a variety of channels. A critical reminder 
was a pop-up window that was displayed each time they logged into 
Student Access+, an authenticated portal to all enterprise systems 
available to students, until they completed the tutorial. Perhaps most 
effectively, the deans’ offices in each school received weekly lists of 
those students who had not completed the tutorial. These students 
were contacted individually to remind them of the need to complete 
the tutorial by the deadline. Those students who did not complete the 
tutorial by the deadline were to be prevented from pre-registering 
in November for Spring semester classes.  With one exception, all 
students required to take the tutorial have completed it before pre-
registration begins.
sT Ud e n T sU C C e s s CoMpLeTi n g Th e TU To r i a L
The tutorial was launched in Fall 2003 and has been a 
requirement for all new students in each subsequent academic year.  
We have used various means to assess its effectiveness.
 
KeyQuiz, the software that runs the tutorial, includes reports on:
• Who has completed the tutorial
• When it was completed
• The percent of answers correct and incorrect in the pre- 
and post-test and in the tutorial
• Number of people who started the tutorial by date
The total number of users that completed the tutorial in 
2003 is 1962, 2004 equals 1843, and in 2005 there were 1954, 
including the 24 students at our new Qatar campus.  These numbers 
incorporate anyone who completed the tutorial, so they contain those 
required to take it plus any others who completed it.
Lo e x-2006    129 -a tu t o r i a l  w i t h  a tw i s t:  h o w Pl a g i a r i s m ...-Each year we have used the data collected by the 
KeyQuiz tool to review and revise the questions and content of 
the tutorial to improve student learning.  The results indicate that 
student understanding has improved.  The first year only 58% of 
students correctly answered the post-test questions while in 2005 
80% correctly answered the questions.
In Fall 2004 we surveyed students from all four 
undergraduate schools who had taken the tutorial and who had 
direct contact with their dean’s office. We gathered information 
about how long it took to complete the tutorial, how many sessions 
they needed to complete it, what they thought was the most 
important thing they learned, in which areas they would like more 
information, and whether they found the tip sheet helpful. Most 
completed the tutorial in about two hours or less, our target time-
frame. Many reported that they had printed the tip sheet from the 
end of the tutorial it or bookmarked it in their browser.
We included two questions in the survey designed to find 
out what students learned about the library and about academic 
integrity. The top five responses to “the most important thing about 
the library” learned were:
• Using GEORGE (the online catalog)
• The variety of research tools available
• Finding journals and using Journal Finder
• Developing their research skills
• The availability of friendly librarians for consultation and 
assistance, and how to locate books
 The top five “most important thing about academic 
integrity” learned from the tutorial were:
• Importance of citing information sources
• The definition of plagiarism
• Honor Code and the importance of academic integrity
• Getting permission to reuse old work
• Collaboration
The Scholarly Research and Academic Integrity tutorial 
seems to have its greatest impact on Honor System cases in the 
Fall.  In the 2002-03 school year, for instance—before the tutorial 
was instituted—12 cases were brought against first year students 
in the Fall; 8 in the Spring.  However, in 2003-04, after the tutorial 
began, there were only 3 cases in the Fall yet 10 in the Spring.  
Similarly, for 2004-05, there were 4 cases in the Fall and 19 in 
the Spring against first year students.  In response to this unusual 
distribution of cases, we sent a mini-review of academic integrity 
issues to all undergraduate students in early February 2006 with the 
hope that the reminder will reduce the number of Spring semester 
cases.ho w di d pLa g i a r i s M ad v a n Ce LiBr a r Y re s e a r Ch

Faculty and academic administrators care deeply about 
the integrity of the scholarly conversation. By taking advantage 
of this concern, the Library was able to achieve the goal of 
introducing all new students to its services and resources and 
demonstrating that it is a partner in the scholarly conversation. 
Working on the tutorial with the Honor Council and others 
helped us make connections with those on campus who are 
concerned about university-wide issues that are not the sole 
responsibility of any given department. In addition to the tutorial 
collaboration, we have worked with the John Carroll program, 
an honors program, to team-teach a one-credit, pass/fail research 
course for the two years it existed.  We are implementing a 
closer collaboration with the Writing Center to enhance research 
training for Writing Center student tutors.  With the University’s 
Office of International Programs we are discussing ways to 
provide better research support for students studying abroad.  
Finally, we have been working with the Center for New Designs 
in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), the University’s center 
for teaching excellence, to find ways to enhance undergraduate 
research through the proposed Undergraduate Learning Initiative 
(ULI).
What are the university-wide concerns on your campus 
that your library research instruction program can enhance?  Find 
what will work—what will bring allies to your cause—and other 
opportunities will arise. Aligning our goals to take advantage of 
synergies with other University partners has achieved far more 
for our library research instruction agenda than would be possible 
on our own.

To better understand what is meant by “academic 
integrity”, and the issues involved with the idea, we conducted 
a literature review on the topic of academic integrity in higher 
education, especially undergraduate education. There are four 
main limitations on this research. First, there is no generally 
accepted research definition of “academic integrity,” “academic 
dishonesty,” “cheating,” or even “plagiarism” (e.g., McCabe, 
Travino, & Butterfield’s (2001) distinction between copying 
another’s work vs. failure to footnote another’s idea) (Lambert et 
al, 2003.). Second, the studies rely mainly on self-reported data 
which can lead to survey results that exaggerate the amount student 
cheating (Crown & Spiller, 1998; Mustaine & Tewksbury, 2005). 
Third, many studies use differing survey time-frames, ranging 
from as short as six-months (e.g., Mustaine & Tewksbury, 2005) 
to a student’s entire collegiate career (Lambert et al, 2003.) Finally, 
the range of cheating behaviors studied can vary from a limited 
focus on several aspects (e.g., plagiarism and test cheating) to all 
types (Lambert et al, 2003).
These limitations notwithstanding, the broader studies 
provide a sobering picture of academic dishonesty.  Estimates of 
the overall number undergraduates who cheated at least once in 
their academic career range from 35.4% (Mustaine & Tewksbury, 
2005) to 82% (McCabe, et al, 2001.) Over time, McCabe, Trevino, 
and Butterfield’s (2001) longitudinal study found that test/exam 
cheating (defined as “copying on an exam”, “using crib or cheat 
notes”, or “helping someone else to cheat” (p. 223)) rose from 
39% in 1963 to 64% in 1993. Written work cheating (defied as 
plagiarism, “fabricated or falsified a bibliography”, “turned in work 
done by someone else”, or “copying a few sentences of materials 
without footnoting them in a paper” (p. 223)) increased only 
slightly from 65% (1963) to 66% (1993), while overall cheating 
rose from 75% (1963) to 82% (1993).Currently, there is no equivalent data on academic 
dishonesty available for Radford University (RU). RU has 
adopted an Honor Code system (http://www.radford.edu/~dos-
web/academicintegrity.htm) that covers very similar types of 
cheating used by McCabe, Trevino, and Battlefield’s (2001) 
longitudinal study.  While the Honor Code is posted throughout 
campus and published in class syllabi, there is no campus-wide 
initiative to educate students about academic integrity.  It is up 
to either individual professors or the students themselves to 
make the effort.
LiBr a r i e s  a n d aCa d e MiC inTe g r i T Y
Although academic integrity covers many different activities, 
librarians focus on those which are strongly tied to research.  ACRL’s 
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education  
addresses these in several different places.  Under standard 2, outcomes 
5a, 5c, and 5d all directly apply.  The information literate student, 
according to outcome 5a, “selects among various technologies the 
most appropriate one for the task of extracting the needed information 
(e.g., copy/paste software functions, photocopier, scanner, audio/
visual equipment, or exploratory instruments)” (“Information Literacy 
Competency Standards for Higher Education”, 2005, p. 10).  It is 
interesting that the ACRL standards include this purely technological 
process of “extracting” the information efficiently as a separate 
competency.  It appears that for many students, their proficiency in this 
purely “technological” piece of the process is perhaps running ahead of 
their competency and understanding of the other, ethical skills addressed 
in the following outcomes.  Outcome 5c pertains directly to the actual 
process of citing:  “…..differentiates between the types of sources cited 
and understands the elements and correct syntax of a citation for a 
wide range of resources.”  Similarly, according to Outcome 5d, the 
information literate student “records all pertinent citation information 
for future reference” (“Information Literacy Competency Standards for 
Higher Education”, 2005, p. 10-11).ex pLo r i n g  Th e LiBr a r i a n ’s roLe i n pr oMoTi n g aCa d e MiC

and paraphrasing: the information literate student “restates textual 
concepts in his/her own words and selects data accurately.”  This student 
also “Identifies verbatim material that can be then appropriately quoted” 
(“Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education”, 
2005, p. 11).
Also addressing paraphrasing and direct quotations, outcomes 
c. and d. of Standard 4 state that the information literate student “integrates 
the new and prior information, including quotations and paraphrasing, in 
a manner that supports the purposes of the product or performance” and 
“manipulates digital text, images, and data, as needed, transferring them 
from their original locations and formats to a new context.  (“Information 
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education”, 2005, p. 
13). Finally, the information literate student “selects an appropriate 
documentation style and uses it consistently to cite sources,” and “posts 
permission granted notices, as needed, for copyrighted material.” 
(Standard V ., Outcome 3 a. and 3 b., “Information Literacy Competency 
Standards for Higher Education,” 2005, p. 14).
Over time it became clear to us that a long-standing 
weakness of the Standards has been its assumption that campus faculty, 
administrators, and librarians will decide amongst themselves who will 
be responsible for teaching which Standard.  In conversations about 
this problem, we realized it was indicative of a larger issue with the 
Standards: this is a document which was created by librarians, but not 
solely for librarians. In the preamble, it says, “Incorporating information 
literacy across curricula, in all programs and services, and throughout 
the administrative life of the university, requires the collaborative 
efforts of faculty, librarians, and administrators” (“Information Literacy 
Competency Standards for Higher Education,” 2005). Yet the Standards 
were developed by only one of these groups.  If the Standards were not 
a result of collaboration, how can they be easily accepted and distributed 
throughout a campus environment?
This situation puts librarians into an awkward position.  
Most faculty and administrators do not understand what is meant by 
“information literacy”, and if they do, they are referring to general 
concepts and not the ACRL framework.   If a librarian is lucky enough to 
find faculty and administrators who are open to the idea of information 
literacy, it then falls upon him or her to educate them on the ACRL 
Standards on an individual basis.  
As a result, very few campuses have all their groups working 
together, incorporating information literacy “across curricula, in all 
programs and services, and throughout the administrative life of the 
university.”  Further complications arise when universities and colleges 
do not have a campus consensus on academic integrity issues.    When 
the responsibility for academic integrity is spread throughout different 
campus units, with no superior party setting policies and striving for 
consistency, chaos can ensue.  In many places, no one is designated to 
teach students how to avoid plagiarism, whether certain actions impact 
copyright, how to correctly cite sources, or how to use citation software.  
That doesn’t mean students do not need such instruction; in fact, many 
students flounder.  As Blair Brainard, Head of Reference and Instruction 
at Radford University’s McConnell Library, often says, “Librarians abhor 
a vacuum.”  When librarians see a need going unfilled, we often step in.  This is certainly true of academic integrity promotion and instruction.
Both the library literature and reflection on our own experiences 
show that many libraries offer training on plagiarism awareness, correctly 
citing using AP A or MLA, and bibliographic management software like 
EndNote and RefWorks.  Most of the articles detail success stories, 
explaining how the librarians created workshops worthwhile to their 
audiences.  What is often left unexplored, however, is the question of 
whether we should be the ones teaching these workshops.
Te aCh i n g aCa d e MiC inTe g r i T Y Ch aL Le n g e s
 
As mentioned earlier, the ACRL Standards delineate what 
knowledge and skills the information literate student should possess, 
without detailing who should teach them.  Many faculty are quite happy 
to have librarians’ aid in these areas, and librarians are often flattered 
when faculty ask us for help.  Sometimes requests for help are right up our 
alley; for example, helping faculty in detection of plagiarism.  As Denise 
Hamilton explains: “It usually happens like this: An instructor suspects 
plagiarism and wonders if the librarians--who can find anything, after all-
-can confirm the suspicions”  (Hamilton, 2003, p. 27).  Many universities 
subscribe to fee-based services designed to help faculty members easily 
detect plagiarism, such as Turnitin.com, and faculty often turn to librarians 
for information and assistance with such services.  Additionally, there 
are many sophisticated techniques which can be used with free internet 
search engines like Google to identify plagiarized material.  Since 
librarians are doing more and more instruction on how to use Google 
and other search engines, it is not surprising that they are being asked to 
use this expertise to ferret out suspected plagiarism.  Also, as more of the 
resources students are using come from online library databases , the best 
way to confirm suspected plagiarism may be to do a literature search in a 
library database – and some librarians have developed very sophisticated 
methods for attacking this challenge (Bugeja, 2000).
 
When it comes to deterring plagiarism however, many 
librarians feel out of their element in the classroom.  In our workshops, 
while explaining plagiarism to students, we realized that they can 
parrot back why plagiarism was bad but cannot actually paraphrase an 
original source.  They lack the skill set to avoid plagiarism.  We added 
paraphrasing and summarizing exercises to our workshop, but we teach 
it with qualms; we are not English professors.  
 
Trying to correctly cite a resource (especially one online) using 
APA or MLA is especially tricky for a number of reasons.  First, there is 
the challenge of interpreting the citation handbook, deciding which format 
is most similar to the odd case a student has brought to the librarian.  At 
the end of April 2006, librarians on the Information Literacy Instruction 
Listserv (ILI-L) discussed the proper way to use tinyURL and how to 
cite one’s own forum posting (Godavari, 2006; Ostrow, 2006).  Even if 
we think we’ve figured it out, there is another significant obstacle: the 
professors themselves.
Lo e x-2006    125 -exPl o r i n g  t h e liBr a r i a n ’s ro l e i n Pr o m o t i n g ...- Professors often have very strong feelings about academic 
integrity.  While all of them would agree that copying and pasting 
without attribution is plagiarism, little consensus exists beyond that 
black-and-white example.  Professors at RU have revealed differing 
ideas of what constitutes an adequate paraphrase, what kind of facts 
count as “common knowledge” and even whether helping a classmate 
with homework was considered cheating.  Many instructors emphasize 
formatting citations correctly, but a disturbing number seem to have 
their own versions of APA, such as changing the way library database 
articles should be cited, or when page numbers should be given.  It is 
not uncommon for a professor to insist something be done as it was 
done at his doctorate program- even if no other university did it that 
way!
ad d r e s s i n g  Ch aL Le n g e s
 
While libraries may abhor a vacuum, it is equally important 
that they not operate in one.  Many of us teach students how to avoid 
plagiarism and answer their citation style format questions, but the 
professors are the ultimate judges.  They are the ones who will grade the 
resulting paper or project and be the ones to decide whether plagiarism 
is an issue and if a citation is formatted accurately.  We are not in a 
position to assert ourselves as experts in academic integrity.
 
We can however be part of a wider approach to the problems 
of plagiarism, copyright, and citation styles.  When problems arise, we 
need to talk to individual instructors about their students’ questions and 
concerns.  It is especially important to involve the faculty member when 
the professor’s advice seems to contradict the formal citation manual.  
Many times, the professor relies on his memories of APA and may 
not know about new revisions or the APA website ( www.apastyle.or g).  
Since instructors will sometimes mark down for incorrect citations, it is 
imperative that students and professors work from the same playbook.
 
Ideally, we will try to affect change at a higher level.  
Librarians should create strategic partnerships with selected 
campus units that will allow both to leverage limited staff resources 
by creating joint efforts to meet common challenges to academic 
integrity. We recommend that you partner with your university’s 
writing center to share citation and plagiarism mitigation efforts. 
Consider strengthening ties with department that request a lot of 
library instruction, such as the English Department for freshman 
composition courses at RU, from which you can learn first hand 
about the academic integrity issues they encounter from their 
students. Together you can then develop joint solutions which 
will allow you to work  with professors.  Optimally, librarians and 
departments will collaborate on plagiarism and citation guidelines, 
generating a standard by which everyone in the department will 
be consistent.
We also need to develop the habit of environmental scanning, 
or a systematic awareness of what is coming (or may come) to your 
campus that can affect academic integrity. Watch for new technologies officially or unofficially under-review for possible adoption; these will 
often be discussed at faculty workshops and administrative meetings. 
Then evaluate how these new technologies might impact academic 
integrity. Will they provide new opportunities for cheating and 
plagiarism? Or will they provide possible countermeasures to cheating, 
such as if your university adopted Turnitin.com?  Then, decide how 
the librarians could best be part of the technology.  V olunteer to be 
involved with the technology; to wait to be asked is to be either ignored 
or given responsibilities you’d rather not have.  Remember to foster 
collaboration with other campus units; we can be most effective when 
working with others.

 Students, today more than ever before, are immersed in 
a culture of dishonesty. They see Oprah publicly castigating James 
Frey, the author of A Million Little Pieces , for distortions, lies, and 
exaggerations in his “memoir.” The news reports talk of prestigious 
scientists who are discredited at Seoul University for falsifying data 
after having claimed to clone human embryos. A New York Times  
reporter is caught either fabricating stories or plagiarizing them.1 This 
is the culture that young people find themselves in, and the message 
they seem to hear is “go ahead and be dishonest as long as you don’t 
get caught.”  The Internet provides easy opportunities to plagiarize 
and even offers advertisements for term papers for sale. Most young 
people today freely copy, exchange, and download copyrighted songs, 
videos, and TV shows from file-sharing sites. While students know 
that it’s not legal, they don’t believe that they are doing anything wrong 
ethically, mainly because “everybody is doing it.”  Based on a 2002 
survey, Don McCabe’s report from The Center for Academic Integrity 
indicates that, “On most campuses, 70% of students admit to some 
cheating. Close to one-quarter of the participating students admitted 
to serious test cheating in the past year and half admitted to one or 
more instances of serious cheating on written assignments.”2  Roig and 
Caso (2005) report that 72% of the student participants claimed to have 
used a fraudulent excuse in college at least once.3 As one can see, the 
problem of ethical behavior with regard to information and academic 
integrity is much broader than just the issue of plagiarism.

 Information ethics can be taught in a variety of settings, 
including philosophy, English, journalism or mass communication 
courses. Library science courses that teach information literacy 
concepts are another appropriate place to teach information ethics. 
Librarians may be called upon to teach information ethics as part of course-integrated instruction. Finally, when there are campus wide 
efforts to teach faculty and students about academic integrity or 
information ethics, the library faculty can offer their perspectives on 
plagiarism, copyright, and fair use. At the University of South Florida, 
information ethics is a unit taught as part of an undergraduate course 
on Library and Internet Research Skills.4 The University of South 
Florida, located in Tampa, Florida, is the second largest university 
in the Southeast, with campus enrollment at about 35,000 students. 
Library and Internet Research Skills (LIS 2005) is a three credit hour, 
fifteen week class taught by instructors in the School of Library and 
Information Science. The course can be an elective for any student on 
campus, but is a required course for Mass Communication majors.

 Students in LIS 2005 classes work in an electronic classroom 
that contains about 25 computers. Quite understandably, the computers 
are as much a distraction as an asset in exploring the world of 
information. At the start of each class period, teachers request that 
students close out their chat sessions, finish their email correspondence, 
or complete the homework lab activities on their computers. Like so 
many Generation Yers, students who take LIS 2005 like to multitask 
and it can be very difficult to keep their undivided attention. In Kate 
Manual’s (2002) article about teaching information literacy concepts 
to Generation Y , she points out that 17-19 year olds have “visual and 
kinesthetic learning styles” and that they learn more holistically. “Gen 
Yers generally need to see the big picture, in every sense of the word, 
when being introduced to concepts and procedures.”5  Thus, active 
learning works better with these students than direct instruction.  
Moreover, Grassian and Kaplowitz (2001) point out that 
“students do not learn much just sitting in classes listening to 
teachers…they must talk about what they are learning, write 
about it, relate it to past experiences, apply it to their daily 
lives.”6  This is especially true when teaching ethical issues 
surrounding information. Lecturing students about ethics does 
not have the same impact as active learning, where students 
process, discuss, and debate ethical issues with their peers and ar i e w  a n d rUnYa n

 While instructors need to present some informational 
content about copyright, legal protections, plagiarism, and fair 
use to undergraduates, it helps to offer them a bigger picture 
of these issues within the context of student inquiry. A good 
place to begin is to ask students who they think plagiarizes 
and why.  It’s clear at the outset of these discussions that most 
undergraduates understand that plagiarism is unacceptable, but 
the variety of responses they offer indicate that the matter is 
complex and reasons for student cheating and plagiarism are 
not cut and dried. Student responses to the question of why 
students plagiarize include: “They (students) are lazy!” “They 
don’t know that they are plagiarizing.” Still others tend to 
blame their teachers. One student said, “Some professors are 
just always looking for it and don’t cut students any slack.” 
Another student complained that some teachers at the high 
school level don’t assign documented papers nor do they grade 
them carefully, so students get the wrong idea, thinking that 
plagiarizing is “no big deal.”  Given what research shows 
us about student behaviors related to ethics and information 
(such as copying or downloading copyrighted music) it’s not 
surprising that students with poor writing skills coming out of 
high school think that it’s not important to cite sources carefully.  
 
de sCr i pTi o n o f in sTrU C T i o n: Us i n g sCe n a r i o s
 After some general discussion about plagiarism, students 
participate in an in-class group activity involving scenarios. 
Arranged in groups of three to five students, each group is given 
a scenario where they are asked to act as judges, give the type 
of offense, and offer a verdict. Each group reads the scenario 
aloud, discusses the verdict and their reasoning, and records their 
answers. Later, all groups are required to share their scenarios 
with the entire class. It is during the analysis phase of scenarios 
that instructors then offer additional information about local 
university policies about plagiarism, rules about citing sources 
that are part of some scenarios, copyright law information, and 
more detailed definitions of concepts like common knowledge or 
fair use. Adding more substantive information when students are 
invested in their analyses means that they will be more receptive 
to that information contextualized into the bigger picture.  The 
scenarios provide excellent teachable moments. For example, 
students often do not think there is anything ethically wrong 
with citing a quote from a book that they accessed from a journal 
article as though they had consulted the book. In the debate that 
ensues, the instructor can not only argue that it is unethical, but 
also show students that there are appropriate and ethical ways to 
cite a primary source that is quoted within a secondary source 
without doing anything wrong. 
 re fLeC Ti o n o n in sTrU C T i o n: Le s s o n s  Le a r n e d
     In teaching this unit to students, it’s clear that there is 
much they do not know about plagiarism, copyright, or fair use. For example, using some scenarios revealed that some students simply 
do not know how to paraphrase or summarize correctly and end up 
with statements that are too close to the original. This most likely 
happens because students tend to copy and paste material, change a 
few words here and there, and think they are paraphrasing. Students 
are also unsure of what they should or shouldn’t cite. When told 
that students must provide a citation when using an image from 
the World Wide Web for a project, students are surprised. They 
are even more surprised to find out that one cannot paste in others’ 
images from a Google image search as visuals for their own Web 
publications without permission from the creator. The thorniest area 
of discussion with students involved copyright infringements. Most 
of the Generation Yers seem to feel entitled to help themselves to any 
piece of music, video, or television show they can download from a 
peer-to-peer network without paying for the material. Even though 
they know it is illegal and that some would view it as unethical, 
most of them believe that the laws are “unfair” because “everyone 
does it.” They tend to rationalize their positions by saying that some 
music groups don’t mind the extra publicity and they believe that as 
long as they are copying or downloading for their own use and not 
distributing copyrighted materials for profit, that they aren’t doing 
anything wrong. Pointing out the potential lawsuits and fines does 
not seem to have much of an effect on students. Part of the problem 
is that undergraduates hear confusing and mixed messages about 
copyright from the Internet itself and from their friends. While LIS 
2005 instructors do not think they will significantly change students’ 
attitudes about copyright, they feel that by engaging them in thinking 
critically about ethics and the law, they at least raise awareness 
about the potential consequences of such behaviors.  File-sharing 
is a fact of life with Generation Yers and may contribute to why 
they are shocked when the consequences of another kind of stealing, 
plagiarism, are so severe. While none of this seems to be very much 
of a “big deal” to students, it’s important for parents, teachers, and 
educators to explain that not only unethical behavior in school is 
unacceptable, but unethical behavior with regard to copyrighted 
material is also unacceptable. 
Co nC L U s i o n
 Teaching students about information ethics is a very 
important part the information literacy curriculum. The ACRL 
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education 
addresses ethical behavior in Standard Five: “The information 
literate student understands many of the economic, legal, and 
social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses 
and uses information ethically and legally.” Under Standard Five 
an outcome listed is that students demonstrate an understanding 
of intellectual property, copyright, and fair use of copyrighted 
material.” 7 Given student attitudes and the culture of the Internet, 
this may be one of the biggest challenges to educators in higher 
education. Using scenarios can be one way to make this material 
more real to students and more applicable to their daily lives.

The Millennial Generation presents new challenges 
for today’s librarians. Born between 1982 and 2002, this is the 
largest generation in U.S. history and will be entering college 
in record numbers over the next ten years. Library literature 
identifies the Millennials as a specific user group with 
distinguishing characteristics; they are self-assured, optimistic, 
well-educated, collaborative, and open-minded. They rely on 
friendships, and can share their opinions instantaneously with 
a vast social network via new technologies. Millennials expect 
customization in their learning environments and have high 
expectations for today’s academic libraries.
Freshman orientation is the first impression of the 
academic library for most of these students.  It is often viewed 
by staff as a “make it or break it” moment, especially in schools 
where there is no formal information literacy program.  To 
better understand library freshman orientations at liberal arts 
colleges, we conducted a study of library orientation programs 
at Oberlin Group colleges.  
In 2005, Swarthmore College developed a winning 
freshman orientation program-- the most successful orientation 
to date-- that meets the learning preferences of this generation 
by incorporating technology, structure and leadership by 
library staff, fun, silliness, experiential activities, exposure 
to positive people, personal interactions, and rewards.  In 
this paper we discuss our process of goal-setting, program 
development, and assessment for freshman orientation, and 
conclude with best practices for developing dynamic freshman 
orientation programs that provide Millennials with a positive 
first impression of the academic library.Th e MiL Le n n i a L ge n e r a Ti o n: wh o ar e Th eY?
 Millennials now make up the bulk of undergraduate 
students in liberal arts colleges; in 2002, 6.9 million Millennials 
were enrolled in college, and by 2012, they are expected to 
increase to 13.3 million (Coomes & DeBard, 12).  For librarians, 
understanding Millennials’ characteristics and learning styles 
is crucial in order to provide effective service and learning 
opportunities for this new generation of college library users.   
 
 As a group, Millennials have characteristics that distinguish 
them from previous generations (see DeBard, 2004; Howe & Strauss, 
2000; DiGilio, Lynn-Nelson, & Reis, 2004; Gardner & Eng, 2005).  
Millennials are pragmatic, achievement-oriented, and hardworking.  
They are self-assured and optimistic about their futures.  They are 
highly collaborative and team-oriented, as opposed to the “loner” 
stereotype of Generation X.  They are respectful of others’ ideas, both 
adults and their peers, and they expect their ideas to be welcomed and 
valued.  The most ethnically diverse generation, they are open-minded 
and socially-conscious.  
This generation makes a strong departure from earlier 
generations in their communication and technology skills.  
Millennials are constantly using new modes of communication 
including blogs, My Space, cell phones, and text messaging.  They 
expect the ability to customize their technological environments, 
from creating iPod play lists, to designing their own web pages, to 
choosing their ring tones.  
Millennials are engaged, ambitious students with 
distinct learning styles (for literature on Millennials learning 
styles, see DiGilio, Lynn-Nelson, & Reis, 2004; Howe & 
Strauss, 2000; Manuel, 2002; Weiler, 2005). As visual learners, 
Millennials are image oriented rather than text oriented.  With 
a low threshold for boredom or memorization, they need 
interactive, customized learning experiences that are practical 
and fun.  They welcome active learning opportunities, such as 
kinesthetic and hands-on experiences.  wh e e Le r a n d ha r r i s

To address the needs of our changing student profile, 
Swarthmore College Library has experimented with library freshman 
orientation over the past few years.  Without a formalized information 
literacy program, orientation is the one time all incoming students are a 
captive audience.  Last year we struck upon a winning formula: clearly 
defined goals, staff guided tours, emphasis on personalization, and 
activities that play to Millennial learning styles.  The use of a simple 
assessment tool indicated that our orientation was a success.
Over the summer, the library orientation coordinator 
collaborated with the student orientation committee and library staff to 
determine what the freshman should learn from the library’s orientation.   
Students highlighted “how to get help,” the reference librarians, and 
the reference desk as the most important things for freshman to learn, 
while librarians said using reserves and the library OPAC were most 
important.  With this input, the library orientation committee decided to 
focus on the following clear, achievable goals to inform our orientation 
activities.  
Goal 1: Show the personal face of the library
We wanted students to have a positive, warm, friendly first 
impression of the library.  We decided that a staff-guided tour was 
the best way to introduce students to our friendly staff.  Although we 
provided a general script, we encouraged staff to let their personalities 
show during the tour.  For example, we encouraged them to share 
“library lore” or to talk about their favorite part of the library.
Goal 2: “We’re here to help!”
Rather than overwhelm students with vast amounts of 
information, we decided to focus on how to get help, so that when they 
do have an information need, they’ll know how to ask.  Tour guides 
took students to the reference desk and lead a discussion of the role 
of a reference librarian.  We handed out bookmarks with images of 
people helping each other, examples of questions students can ask at 
the reference desk, contact information, and the slogan “We’re here to 
help!” 
Goal 3: Location, location, location
We wanted students to get an idea of library locations, from 
different libraries on campus to finding a book in the stacks.  We hung 
a giant, full-color map of campus in the lobby and labeled our multiple 
libraries; it was such a hit, we left it up and campus tours have started 
pointing it out!  We organized an exhibit in the main lobby of the library, 
in which each branch library created its own display.  We included the 
library’s computer classroom as a tour stop, where we demonstrated 
how to find a book in Tripod (our OPAC), how to read a Library of 
Congress call number, and then we went to find the book in the stacks.  
We visited the Reserves desk, Reference desk, and DVD and video 
collection, an all important location for students.Goal 4: Make it interactive and fun
To connect with Millennial students, we wanted to provide an 
interactive, fun learning environment.  We encouraged student group 
leaders to share their experiences about the library.  We chose quirky and 
fun reference books from the collection and passed them around when 
we visited the Reference Desk.  In the computer classroom, we drew 
a silly quiz on the board called “What is Tripod?” with three choices; 
a picture of a camera on a tripod, “The name of our combined library 
catalog,” and a picture of a three-legged alien.  Before demonstrating a 
search in Tripod, we asked the students take the quiz.
We used a raffle for five iPod shuffles as an incentive to 
complete the tour as well as a way to assess what the students learned 
and get attendance statistics.  At the end of the tour, we asked students 
to fill out a raffle ticket with their name, email, and the answer to the 
question, “What is the most important thing you learned about the 
library today?”  We had the highest ever attendance, with a total of 
392 raffle tickets completed out of a class of 386 (we let student group 
leaders complete raffles as well).  All but one student indicated what 
they learned.  Common answers included how to use Tripod, knowledge 
of the reference desk and reference librarians, where to ask for help, 
the Library of Congress classification system, and that librarians are 
friendly and helpful.   
oBe rLi n gr oUp CoL Le g e s: wh aT MaKe s a sU C C e s s f U L 
or i e n TaTi o n?
To assess best practices for library orientations in other 
institutions, we surveyed instruction librarians at our 75 peer institutions 
in the Oberlin Group, an association of the liberal arts college libraries 
in the U.S.  We used Survey Monkey [www.surveymonkey.com] 
to create a 22-question online survey.  The response rate was 58%.  
Approximately half of the respondents said they do not conduct a 
freshman library orientation, although the vast majority of libraries 
surveyed have an information literacy program of some kind.  Of those 
with an orientation program, four rated their orientation programs as 
“very successful.”  The common factors among these programs included 
the following.
•	 They described themselves as “revisionist” in their  
  orientation planning, taking into account last year’s success   
  and failures and making adjustments to their program.
•	 The library orientation was mandatory.
•	 They coordinated with campus groups such as the college’s  
  orientation planning committee, the First Year Program   
  directors, and student groups.  
•	 Many types of staff were involved in the orientations   
  including public services staff, technical services   
  staff, support staff, special collections staff, and students. 
•	 They had clear, attainable goals (see Table 1).
•	 They used multiple assessment tools to evaluate success   
  including attendance statistics, student evaluations, anecdotal  
  evidence, and staff responses to the program.

Based on our understanding of Millennials, our own 
experiences here at Swarthmore, and our research into Oberlin 
College library freshman orientations, we’ve identified the 
following best practices for developing a successful freshman 
orientation.
Plan Ahead
•	 Get in touch with the campus orientation committee   
 over the summer to coordinate times and possible        
 themes. 
•	 Ask staff and students what they think are the most   
 important things freshman should learn.  
•	 Request funding from campus orientation committee.
•	 Work to make the library orientation a mandatory part of  
 the freshman experience. 
•	 Contact student group leaders right before the   
 orientation. Let them know what you’re planning and  
 encourage them to participate by sharing their 
 experiences during the tour.
Get Staff Involved
•	 Invite all types of library staff to participate - not just   
 public services.  The more staff you have on board, the  
 easier it will be to pull off a successful orientation.
•	 Clearly communicate your goals to staff.
•	 Have a dress rehearsal with staff beforehand, and   
 encourage questions and feedback.
•	 If you do a library tour, create a script, but encourage   
 staff to personalize it.
•	 Hold a debriefing with staff afterwards to get   
 their feedback, observations, and suggestions for future  
 orientations.
•	 Communicate your success to staff; for example, an   
 email with highlights of the nice things the students said  
 about the experience.
•	 Thank everyone involved; they’ll be more likely to help  
 out next year!Set Clear Goals
•	 Don’t try to cover everything.  Identify what they have  
 to know now, and focus on that.
•	 Get input from students and staff when setting goals.
•	 Communicate your goals to the orientation committee  
 and any faculty, students, and staff that are involved.  
Address Millennial Learning Styles
•	 Personalize the tour by telling them your name and   
 something about yourself.
•	 Smile!  Be welcoming.  Make eye contact.  Be positive.
•	 Create opportunities for visual learning, such as   
 illustrations, displays, and exhibits.
•	 Create opportunities for kinesthetic learning, such as   
 passing around reference books, asking students to find  
 and pull a book from the shelves, and inviting students  
 to check out the materials that they find.
•	 When teaching the catalog, don’t use a canned search.  
 Instead, make it interactive and ask “What’s your favorite   
 novel?”  If you don’t have that novel in the catalog, show  
 them interlibrary loan.  Explain what you’re doing and  
 seeing as you navigate the catalog.
•	 Ask students for feedback and encourage questions during  
 the tour.  Be receptive and open to their questions.
Evaluate Your Program
•	 Use multiple assessment tools such as attendance   
 statistics, staff evaluations, student feedback, and focus  
 groups.
•	 If you have a raffle, why not get some feedback at the same   
 time?  Combine your raffle ticket with a simple question like,  
 “What did you learn about the library today?”
•	 Contact student group leaders after the orientation to get  
 their feedback.Table 1

We will be seeing Millennials in the library through 
the year 2020.  Although we can’t predict exactly how our users 
will evolve, we can prepare ourselves by being flexible, keeping

about and working with Millennial preferences and learning 
styles, we can forge lasting relationships between students and 
the library, and have a little fun along the way.

MySpace calls itself “a place for friends,” with 
approximately 71 million MySpace profiles (myspace.com). Upon 
creating an account, a user can customize a profile cosmetically, 
establish security parameters, and enter information such as schools 
attended, birthday, marital status, personal headline, favorite 
music, as well as upload photos. Options to customize MySpace 
are innumerable with HTML code. A Google search on “MySpace 
code generator” or “MySpace profile editor” will provide lists of 
web sites where users can find HTML code that can be pasted into 
various portions of a profile.
Once a profile has been established, a user can search for 
people and invite them to be “friends,” as well as receive invitations 
via email. Becoming a “friend” with another user can allow access 
to that user’s blog and/or bulletins. Along with a personal profile, 
groups can be easily created and friends invited to join groups. 
Facebook calls itself an online directory in which college 
students can: “look up people at your school, see how people know 
each other, and find people in your classes and groups” (facebook.
com).  Unlike its predecessor MySpace, Facebook requires an email 
address ending in “.edu” to create a profile. With approximately 7 
million users at over 2,000 colleges, it is now the 7th most-trafficked 
site on the Internet (Levy & Stone, 2006). 
Like MySpace, information fields can be completed. 
Information fields specific to Facebook are campus status 
(undergraduate, grad student, alumnus, faculty or staff) and course 
schedule. Kushner (2006) notes, “Ostensibly, this gives the site 
academic potential…using it for stuff like Chaucer study groups 
and car pools to ichthyology lab.” Again, like MySpace, Facebook 
users can invite “friends,” and join or create groups. Facebook also allows for the posting of events visible only to your campus 
(e.g. parties, meetings, field trips, etc.). Facebook, however, has a 
consistent profile template not customizable with HTML code.
LiTe r a T Ur e re v i e w
Recent news coverage on MySpace and Facebook has 
been difficult to miss. Stories have covered pedophiles with false 
identities luring young MySpace users (Mayer-Hohdahl, 2005); 
parents, schools and communities educating youth on issues of 
privacy and internet safety (Gordon, 2006); college administrators 
holding students accountable, and disciplining for, their behaviors 
posted (or pictured) on Facebook; and campus libraries blocking 
access to sites (Bugeja, 2006). Employers investigate job 
candidates’ MySpace/Facebook pages (Read, 2006). High school 
students organized immigration legislation protests on MySpace 
(Gold, 2006). Local bands and famous musicians create MySpace 
profiles to promote their work (Pemberton, 2006). Even politicians 
create profiles (Wedge, 2006).
Online innovations, like MySpace/Facebook, continue 
to transform library policy and practice in delivering instruction, 
reference, and collections. Librarians have embraced advances 
in technology to the extent that academic libraries are constantly 
redefining their roles and “service paradigms” (Moyo, 2004, p. 
229). Online tutorials reinforce or supplement concepts taught in 
traditional instruction, as well as supporting online-only curriculum 
and distance education students (Yi, 2005). Chat, in various forms 
of live reference, has had widespread adoption to augment existing 
reference models, increasing hours of available reference via 
consortium, and supporting users who prefer online communication 
(Ward, 2005). Most recently, blogs, instant messaging, RSS feeds, 
and pod-casts are other ways to reach students through popular 
technologies (Balas, 2005; Bell, 2006; Stephens & Gordon, 
2006). As Ward (2005) noted, students choose chat and other 
technologies primarily for reasons of speed and convenience—
they are “already online” (p. 36). MySpace/Facebook may emerge 
as yet another technology added to librarians’ repertoire.  MeU LeMa n s a n d ChU

literature focusing on MySpace/Facebook, there is some 
information on how similar social networking technologies and 
computer-mediated communications (CMC) are used to facilitate 
information flow and develop relationships. 
CMC’s are most often used to strengthen already existing 
ties (connections/relationships between people) but can be used to 
establish weak ties (e.g. online communities) (Wellman, Haase, 
Witte, & Hampton, 2001). Haythornthwaite (2005) offers a good 
introduction to the research on CMC’s effects on strengthening 
strong ties while also providing an opportunity to establish new, 
weak ties. This is reflected in findings from the authors’ survey and 
focus group. Relationships with strong ties often utilize multiple 
CMC’s; weak ties often utilize only a single type of CMC to 
communicate. Weak ties participate less frequently with a social 
network, but are more likely to provide new and different ideas 
(Wellman, et al, 2001). One might argue, then, that librarians have 
an appropriate role and opportunity as a weak tie.
Particular MySpace/Facebook features can support and 
strengthen ties in the academic arena. Bulletin boards (a feature 
of MySpace/Facebook) have been shown to facilitate student-
student and student-faculty communication, and may also support 
students’ social life (Weskkirich & Milburn, 2003). Bulletin boards 
may also allow students an opportunity to determine their “self-
presentation” and therefore, students may feel more comfortable in 
contributing to course discussions/communications (Kelly, Keaten, 
& Finch, 2002). MySpace’s major feature is the customizability of 
virtually every aspect of a user’s page; “self-presentation” could 
be determined by customizing one’s page. Eveleth, Eveleth, and 
Sarker (2005) also found evidence that an online community can 
provide significant support among students in a class.  Online 
communities for city residents have also been shown to strengthen 
community engagement, feelings of belonging, and the cultivation 
of social network ties (Kavanaugh, Carroll, Rosson, Zin, & Reese, 
2005). The research on CMC’s indicates that MySpace/Facebook 
has the potential to support student learning.

The following provides a brief summary of the authors’ 
methodology, data, and analysis. Further documentation is 
available upon request. 
California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) is a 
baccalaureate and Master’s level university with approximately 
7500 students. As of this writing, there were 3608 MySpace and 
1352 Facebook profiles by individuals who identified themselves 
as current CSUSM students. CSUSM usage data among first-
year students was gathered using a web-based survey instrument. 
One hundred and five  responses were gathered; 89 responses 
were usable. Of 89 responses, 38 students have a MySpace page, 
2 students have a Facebook page, and 49 students have both 
MySpace and Facebook pages. A fair, positive correlation was 
found between number of visits per day and time spent per visit 
(r(89)= .4). Fifty-three percent of users reported using MySpace/
Facebook to network with friends, and 70% reported using it to  “find people” (e.g. old friends). Several comments in both the 
survey and focus group reiterated this trend that pages are being 
used to communicate with friends known offline. Of those who 
reported they had both a MySpace and Facebook page, 90% said 
they use it to communicate with others about school, professors, or 
courses. Fifty percent with only a MySpace page said they use it to 
discuss school professors or courses. 
To supplement and complement the survey, a focus group 
was convened to discuss usage of Myspace/Facebook. In an one 
hour session, focus group participants responded freely to several 
discussion points on MySpace/Facebook: first contact with/
adoption of technology; description of a typical session; benefits/
problems of usage; usefulness/appropriateness in an academic 
setting; role on a commuter campus; and recent headlines and 
press coverage. The discussion was transcribed and analyzed.
In the focus group, two participants were first year students, 
one junior, and one senior in a variety of majors. Two students have 
both MySpace and Facebook pages, and all have a MySpace page. 
Focus group findings on usage reiterated survey results. Students 
indicated a high level of awareness regarding issues of internet 
safety, privacy, and media coverage on MySpace/Facebook. All 
participants discovered MySpace/Facebook via word of mouth, 
and several have experience with similar networking sites (e.g. 
Hi5, Friendster). 
A typical session includes checking email notifications 
and “top” friends’ pages (reading their blogs and viewing pictures), 
looking for and listening to music, and decorating one’s MySpace 
page using HTML code. Benefits of the technology include 
keeping in touch with existing friends, re-connecting with former 
friends, and learning about new people and music. The focus 
group findings support the literature on CMC— participants use 
the technology to keep in contact with people they already know. 
Noted drawbacks include: interpersonal “melodrama” arising 
from use, decrease of face-to-face interaction, and consumption  
of time. In fact, all focus group participants agreed “it would be a 
good thing” if CSUSM blocked access to Myspace/Facebook. The 
students indicated they would prefer Myspace/Facebook for course 
discussion and assignment reminders rather than the campus course 
management software (WebCT). WebCT is not as user-friendly, 
they explained; they are “already at” MySpace/Facebook. One 
participant acknowledged that some students might be “weirded 
out” by faculty presence on MySpace/Facebook. Focus group 
participants were split on the future of MySpace/Facebook: two 
indicated it was a passing “fad,” two said it was “the next email” 
and here to stay. 
pr aC TiCaL inTe g r a Ti o n
Integrating MySpace/Facebook into an information 
literacy program (ILP) can include the establishment of a librarian’s 
own page, a page for a course (in collaboration with an instructor), 
or a page for students in a discipline.  Assessment of instruction 
could be conducted via short quizzes or questions that can be 
posted to a librarian’s page. As seen in the literature, strong ties 
Lo e x-2006    143 -mysPaCe a n d FaCeBo oK: re aCh i n g o u r s t u d e n t s ...-are often characterized by the utilization of many different types of 
CMC. A librarian’s presence to support a class can be seen as even 
stronger with a MySpace page. 
Much has been written about “point-of-need/just in time” 
reference assistance.  MySpace can indicate if a person is online 
and available; students can easily find if a particular librarian 
is available to assist them. Facebook does not have this option. 
However, both have blog and bulletin features. Adding a MySpace/
Facebook page to an existing repertoire of email, phone, and the 
reference desk may contribute to strengthening existing ties and 
establishing new ones. If a librarian is part of a Psychology student 
group, a bulletin posting tips on using PsycINFO could be posted 
and viewed by all students. The authors suggest that the same 
convenience found by Ward (2005) and others can be found with 
MySpace/Facebook, providing students with multiple ways of 
accessing a librarian. Certainly, these technologies require much 
less risk and effort on the part of students to ask for help than at 
the reference desk.
MySpace/Facebook can further the outreach efforts of any 
university library, much in the same way other technologies have 
extended the library’s presence— chat, blogs, instant messaging, 
and so on. MySpace/Facebook can be utilized as an additional 
promotional venue, to create awareness of library services and 
events via blog postings and event announcements. Effectiveness 
can be measured by noting any increase in attendance. Profiles can 
be created for libraries, rather than individual librarians, to present 
a uniform identity while enabling multiple librarians to contribute 
to the maintenance of the page. Students can post comments on the 
library’s page in lieu of, or in addition to, a traditional comments 
box.
MySpace/Facebook may also contribute to retention of 
students, particularly first year students in a largely commuter 
campus, by creating cohorts via groups of common interest, links 
to classmates, professor and librarian, and facilitating a sense of 
belonging to campus. Librarians can stay abreast of campus issues 
by viewing student and group pages. As MySpace/Facebook and 
comparable sites become more popular and established, librarians 
may continue to find new opportunities for integration.
Co nC L U s i o n
There are innumerable opportunities for further research 
into how MySpace/Facebook can be used in the context of the 
academic library. Research into MySpace/Facebook’s adoption 
on residential versus commuter campuses as well as differences 
in adoption by age and degree of adoption (i.e. frequency of use, 
amount of use) could shed more light on the population using these 
services and for what specific purposes. Case studies as well as 
more systematic research on using MySpace/Facebook in content 
delivery, reference assistance, outreach, and information literacy 
instruction can provide a more comprehensive idea of where these 
tools will ultimately fit into academic librarianship. As with other 
new technology, libraries should proceed in adoption appropriate 
to their campus after analysis of the user population.The authors opine that Facebook will emerge as the main 
social networking site for colleges and universities. MySpace 
is being rapidly adopted by the general public, but Facebook 
serves a solely collegiate audience.  The authors submit that these 
technologies show signs that they will stand alongside email and 
the web as vital tools in academic librarianship. In the very least, 
a greater understanding of what these technologies are and how 
students on a particular campus are using them can facilitate a 
better connection to the campus community that libraries support.

literature about information literacy and library instruction can be 
easily overwhelmed. In addition to voluminous publications, there

The objectives of this session of the LOEX 2006 
conference were for participants to be able to identify a modest 
range of resources to use for their own continuing professional 
development as well as for training and mentoring new instruction 
librarians, and to be able to relate these to the knowledge base that 
instruction librarians ideally should have.  The recently posted draft 
of “Proficiencies for Instruction Librarians” by the Association of 
College and Research Libraries (ACRL) at http://www.ala.org/ala/
acrlbucket/is/newsacrl/proficienciescall.htm served as a starter for 
discussion of what academic librarians need to know and be able 
to do. The draft outlines twelve broad proficiencies in alphabetical 
order: 
• Administrative ability
• Assessment and evaluation skills
• Communication skills
• Curriculum knowledge
• Information literacy integration skills
• Instructional design skills
• Planning ability
• Presentation skills
• Promotion skills
• Subject expertise
• Teaching skills
• Teamwork & leadership skillsWhile there was not enough time to delve into the draft 
details, the LOEX conference audience quickly agreed that some 
additional categories should be considered:  technology, especially 
multimedia; intellectual property and academic integrity; marketing 
rather than only promotion; and knowledge of the higher education 
environment and the changing characteristics of the student body. 
Another way of thinking about what instruction librarians 
need to keep up with is to consider the organizational and social, 
as well as the professional context in which they practice. The 
following list overlaps with the “Proficiencies,” but goes well 
beyond them:
• The instruction librarian’s own library’s policies,   
 services, technology, staff, etc.
• His/her own institutional context (faculty, students,   
 culture, etc.)
• Relevant subject expertise
• Evolving professional knowledge and skills in   
 librarianship/ instructional librarianship
• Advances in education--learning theory, cognitive   
 science, adolescent development,  learning    
 styles, culture and learning, online education
• Trends and issues in higher education 
• Innovations in information/communication technology
• Societal/generational change
In short, there is an enormous amount of environmental 
scanning, technical know-how, research and professional literature 
to cover if one is to develop and maintain all the skills and 
knowledge that an instructional librarian needs. Continual and 
focused effort is required in order to keep up, hone skills, and build 
one’s knowledge base.

It is important to recognize that much of our ongoing 
learning is incidental and informal, as we constantly adjust our 
understanding and practice skills as part of our daily routines.  By va rLeJs

be made explicit and organized for more effective recall and 
use. Even deliberate learning projects are more frequently 
conducted through informal means rather than through formal 
continuing education (Auster & Chan, 2004; Varlejs, 1999a 
& b).  We can picture a continuum of informal to formal 
methods:

 Over the last two decades, the resources available for 
anyplace-anytime learning have exploded dramatically, thanks 
to the ubiquitous PC, digital libraries, and the Internet. It is now 
hard to imagine how we communicated and shared knowledge 
before the advent of such remarkable conduits as electronic 
discussion lists.  Increasingly, short seminars and workshops 
are available as webcasts from professional organizations. 
Training in many technical skills is readily found on the 
Internet through clearinghouses such as WebJunction.

Now that so many periodicals are online, it is easier and 
less expensive for librarians to regularly monitor the literature for 
pertinent articles and reviews.  Key library journals for instruction 
librarians are:

 The CLENE Round Table’s newsletter is intended 
for continuing education and staff development providers, and 
therefore has material that to some extent is useful to instruction 
librarians also. The OCLC news releases are a good source of links 
to new research reports form organizations such as Pew, which 
study Internet and other information use by young people as well 
as the general public.
 
 Because the periodical literature and online sources 
come to mind as the most up-to-date sources for staying abreast 
of what we need to know, we should not neglect the monographic 
literature. There are excellent books on instruction librarianship 
and information literacy, but they fall outside the scope of this 
“quick-fix” review.  
Us i n g CUr r e n T aw a r e n e s s /aLe rTi n g se r v i Ce s
There are of course many more useful journals and 
newsletters, but the point of this overview is to keep the number 
manageable.  A very efficient way to cherry-pick the literature is 
to create a personalized current awareness service . Ingenta  is a 
huge database that allows one to specify a number of searches that 
are conducted automatically every week, with results e-mailed to 
the user. Table-of-contents (TOC) alerts for selected journals also 
can be requested for e-mail delivery. If Ingenta  is not available, 
check to see if the journals you are interested in might not offer to 
e-mail the TOC to you upon publication.  The Informed Librarian,  
http://informed librarian.com, provides access to TOCs and 
other services for $29 a year.  If you have access to the Journal 
Lo e x-2006    147 -sTaYi n g Au c o u R AnT:  re s o UrCe s fo r in sTrU C T i o n...-of Academic Librarianship , their “Guide to the Professional 
Literature” column is a quick way to catch some of the 
highlights. To make sure you have not missed anything of 
importance, turn to the annual bibliography published in 
Reference Services Review  (Johnson, 2005).  At the very least, 
consult the American Library Association’s Library Instruction 
Round Table’s annual top twenty article picks (http://www3.
baylor.edu/LIRT).
Rather than relying on your own personal updating 
system, you might want to create a cooperative project at your 
library. For example, if you hold regular instructional staff 
meetings, ten minutes or so might be set aside each time for 
sharing synopses of articles or books read and/or conferences 
or workshops attended. Or, you might want to create a journal 
club, with everyone committed to scanning a certain number 
of journals and sharing the gist of pertinent content over a 
weekly brown bag lunch. Alternatively, you could create a 
blog or wiki for this purpose (see WebJunction for guidance at 
http://www.webjunction.org/do/Navigation?category=11233).  
For an example of a wiki for instruction librarians, see http://
instructionwiki.org.  For background on current awareness, see 
Barr, 2006.  
Once set with your trusted current awareness system, 
it is easy to forget that not every useful item is going to be 
caught in the net. When a specific question arises or there 
is a need to explore a particular aspect of library instruction 
or information literacy, remember to turn to the indexes 
(H.W. Wilson’s Library Literature, LISA, LISTA, ERIC, and 
Education Index).

This leads us to the importance of keeping up with 
trends and issues in higher education. The Chronicle of Higher 
Education  is the first choice. Two journals that are likely to be 
useful to instruction librarians, both for their faculty perspective 
and their practical teaching insights, are College Teaching and 
Teacher Professor .  A blog that provides a quick way to stay 
up to date on higher education is Steven Bell’s “The Kept-
up Academic Librarian,” http://staff.philau/.edu/bells/keepup, 
which abstracts current news and provides links to articles.  
For publications from Educause, an association whose mission 
is to “advance higher education by promoting the intelligent 
use of information technology,” see www.educause.edu.  You 
should be able to set up the alerting services provided by 
Steven Bell and Educause by using RSS feeds (Really Simple 
Syndication), which alert you to new information on the Web 
pages that you select. To learn about RSS, see http://www.llrx.

 There are many Web pages useful to instruction 
librarians. The most important one to monitor regularly 
is ACRL’s Instruction Section and their separate page on 
information literacy, with its links to the Information Literacy 
Institute.  There is now also an ACRL blog that you can receive 
automatically and thus keep up with the bigger picture as well 
(http://www.acrlblog.org).  If you belong to ACRL, you have 
access to the members-only “Updated Internet Resources” at 
http://ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlpubs/crlnews/internetresources.htm.   
This includes “Information literacy sites,” a comprehensive, 
annotated listing, with links, to organizations and conferences, 
guidelines and reports, initiatives and programs, tutorials, 
discussion forums/groups and blogs, journals and articles, 
partnerships and collaboration, intellectual property, technology, 
and assessment. Once you have explored the limited resources 
I have suggested in this presentation and want to explore 
further, this ACRL compilation by Esther Grassian and Michael 
Oppenheim is THE one to use as a touchstone.
 For examples of tutorials and other learning materials, 
there are a number of choices: LOEX; PRIMO, Peer-Reviewed 
Instructional Materials Online, which features tutorials, is at 
http://www.ala.org/ala/acrlbucket/iscommittees/webpages/
emergingtech/primo/index.htm; and the new International 
Information Literacy Resources Directory is at http://www.uv.mx/
usbi_ver/unesco.  The above mentioned instruction wiki has a 
section on teaching resources.  Not specific to library instruction, 
but worth exploring are http://www.merlot.org and http://www.
wisc-online, which is described by Deborah Diller elsewhere in 
these proceedings.
 There are Web sites intended for college teachers that 
can be very helpful to instruction librarians who have to teach 
across the curriculum, as they lead to resources in disciplines. See 
for example, the Center for Support of Teaching and Learning at 
Syracuse http://cstl.syr.edu, which in turn leads to the University 
of Michigan’s Center for Research on Learning and Teaching’s 
“Teaching Strategies and Disciplinary Resources.”

 If you are looking for formal learning opportunities, 
the ACRL Immersion Institute is acclaimed as the gold standard 
for in-depth learning.  The annual LOEX conference also has an 
excellent track record and produces proceedings, published by 
Pierian Press. At ALA conferences, the ACRL Instruction Section 
and the Library Instruction Round Table (LIRT) present programs. 
Every other year there is a LOEX-of-the-West conference, and in 
Canada there is an Annual Workshop on  Instruction in Library Use 
(WILU). For the numerous regional conferences, see the Grassian 
and Oppenheim listing mentioned above.  A related annual 
symposium on intellectual property issues is held annually at the 
University of Maryland.  Short workshops are available online  
 148    L o e x-2006   from ACRL, frequently in the form of webcasts in collaboration 
with the TLT Group (see http://www.TLTgroup.org/OLI/Schedule.
htm).  An increasing number of online courses that might be helpful 
to instruction librarians are available through WebJunction, and 
there are many regional and local organizations across the country 
that provide workshops.

 In addition to monitoring the spheres of librarianship 
and higher education, instruction librarians also need to think 
about how different the current generation is from those closer to 
their own. Teaching methods that may have worked a decade ago, 
may be ineffective with young people who have grown up on 
video games and instant messaging.  Once we start to think about 
this, it is easy to pick up on news items in the media about young 
people and technology that help us to stay “au courant.” There 
are also some deliberate efforts to alert us to pendulum swings, 
such as Beloit College’s annual “mindset” list at http://beloit.
edu/~pubaff/mindset, and Richard Sweeney’s “Millenials” Web 
site at http://www.library.njit.edu/staff-folders/sweeney.

 One hour was not enough time to adequately discuss 
and vote on the most indispensable resources and the most urgent 
“keep-up-with” topics. Insofar as a consensus could emerge, the 
ILI-L discussion list, the ACRL blog, and Research Strategies  
appeared to be the favorite resources, and technology was the 
topic demanding the most constant vigilance.
