ACTIVATING THE ACRL  FRAMEWORK : ACTIVE LEARNING 
DESIGN FOR LIBRARY INSTRUCTION  
MEGHAN KOWA LSKI, CATHERINE MEALS  AND  FAITH RUSK 
INTRODUCTION  
In the summer of 2019, the four reference librarians at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), a   Historically 
Black College and Universit y (HBCU ) in the nation’s capital, undertook a project to engage with the ACRL Framework for 
Information Literacy  to deepen our own understanding of the Framework and translate its theoretical framing into praxis for  our 
library. Our team was familiar with and appreciated the Framework, but we didn’t feel that we were incorporating it much in o ur 
information literacy instruction. We began with two primary goals: establishing a shared analysis of the Framework so that we could 
consistently translate the theory into teaching practice, and creating Framework -oriented, student -centered active learning activities 
that we could incorporate into one -shot and embedded library instruction.  
In our work, we prioritized our insti tutional context and the needs of our students. UDC is an HBCU with a “nontraditional” 
student population. We are an entirely commuter campus, and many students are older, taking classes part -time, or trying to balance 
academics with full -time jobs or care giving responsibilities. Our university’s strategic plan, The Equity Imperative, puts lifelong 
learning at the forefront of its mission. We thus sought to develop Framework -oriented lessons that fostered this drive by emphasizing 
activities that drew from lived experience in addition to classroom learning, and connected information literacy to information needs 
both inside and outside of an academic setting.  
PROJECT APPROACH  
 The team met six times in two -hour sessions over the summer, during times with low patron traffic, and focused each 
meeting on one frame. We specifically sought to make our process discussion -oriented and collaborative, because the library does 
not use a liaison model —librarians teach across all subject areas and often in variou s sections of the same course. Our library team 
has historically been collaborative, but approaching our work with this intention formalized and organized a collaborative approach 
to instruction.  
Prior to each meeting, each team member closely read the te xt of the frame, reviewed related resources on 23 Framework 
Things ( https://23frameworkthings.wordpress.com/ ), and either brainstormed possible new activity ideas to develop or identified 
activities on Project CORA ( https://www.projectcora.org/ ) or the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy Sandbox 
(https://sandbox.acrl.org/ ) to potentially modify for our context. We began each meeting by discussing our interpretat ions of the 
frame, how our existing instruction activities already supported certain dispositions, and difficulties we anticipated that w e would 
face in applying the theory to practice. We then discussed each team member’s activity ideas, some of which wer e very early in 
development and some of which were nearly complete. Following the discussion, each team member chose three ideas —sometimes 
their own, sometimes the ideas of other team members —to develop further, with the goal of creating lesson templates t o populate a 
shared bank of activities that could support beginner, intermediate, and advanced learners. Some activities were built out la ter, after 
the Framework review process, when an idea was appropriate for a particular class context or set of intende d learning outcomes.   
 
10       LOEX -2021   -KOWALSKI , MEALS  AND RUSK- OUTCOMES  
The team’s work helped us situate our existing activities within the Framework, but more importantly spurred the 
development, adaptation, or modification or many activities. As one example, we adapted Sphere of Discourse fr om Project CORA 
(Hoppe, 2019) —an activity that uses a beach ball prop to encourage discussion of various types of information sources and formats, 
values, and evaluation of information (i.e., “Authority is Constructed and Contextual ” and “Information Has Value ”). Team members 
experimented with this activity in instruction sessions to support research assignments both in freshman/sophomore -level general 
education and senior capstone courses. Students and instructors in all courses provided p ositive feedback on the activity, describing 
it as fun and informative, but it appeared to be the most effective in the upper -level classes with interdisciplinary research projects, 
in which students are required to use a variety of source types, rather th an in the general education classes that focused more on 
introducing scholarly sources. We also developed digital learning objects —for instance, a video tutorial on exploration and 
persistence in research to support dispositions in the Research as Inquiry frame (UDC Library, 2019) —which have been quite useful 
for online tutorials and asynchronous instruction.  
The team’s discussions of each frame also encouraged us to modify some of our existing activities to better reflect the 
concepts of the frame and mak e them more student -directed. After reviewing the “Authority is Constructed and Contextual frame, ” 
we made major adjustments to an activity on evaluating sources, moving away from the CRAAP test checklist that many of us had  
relied on. We began instead ask ing students to describe the factors that make a source “good,” brainstorming their own list as a class. 
Students could then  use the class’s list to evaluate a given source and assess whether it was “good” for the research assignment they 
were working on. Though students frequently named characteristics of information that support evaluation within the “Authority is 
Constructed and Contextual ” frame  (such as authorship or publication type)  during the class brainstorm, they often later described 
sources in t he activity as “good” (scholarly) or “bad” (most other sources) regardless of the sources’ context or purpose. The list of 
factors that they had previously developed together provided a foundation for a subsequent class discussion of the nuances of  and 
contextuality of authority that drew on the existing knowledge and experience of information that they brought to the class but may 
not have yet applied in an academic setting. Communicating with students on a personal level and drawing out the connections 
between their real -life experience using information and the academic research context helped them engage more fully with the 
elements of the Framework underlying the activity.  
Developing activities frame by frame also a llowed us to lean on some modularizat ion in instruction planning. With an 
expanded buffet of Framework engaged activities to pull from, we were able to more easily tailor a session to the faculty req uest and 
the needs of the class.  
CHALLENGES  
 The project was very valuable to our own professi onal development and instruction program, but we encountered challenges 
in applying the Framework to instruction. First, we identified a mismatch between some of the information literacy concepts i n the 
Framework and the academic research skills that facul ty typically want us to address in instruction. Our project made plain that 
research skills and information literacy are not one and the same. While faculty generally focus on their students conducting  research, 
we as librarians seek to contextualize acade mic research within the wider scope of information literacy. We were excited and inspired 
by many aspects of the Framework and hoped to incorporate them into our instruction, but frequently found it challenging to m ake 
connections to “teaching research” in  our current context, where students are commonly working on traditional research papers with 
scholarly sources and some portion of faculty expect that our instruction will have a narrow focus on use of library resource s (e.g., 
“show students how to use th e databases”). However, we remain committed to expanding the scope and scale of our instruction and 
our instruction program, and by integrating elements of the Framework to the greatest extent possible within our current cont ext, we 
hope to begin broadenin g faculty perception of what librarians teach.   
 In addition, we found that creating activities for novice learners was difficult, as the Framework seems to assume some 
existing level of research knowledge or familiarity with fundamental information liter acy concepts. Many students at our institution 
bring limited experience in academic research to the classroom, and the frames were often difficult to apply to building a fo undation 
for academic research. A number of our activity ideas that hewed most close ly to the Framework were more appropriate for advanced 
learners and we have not yet had an opportunity to apply these activities since the vast majority of our instruction typicall y occurs 
in introductory and general education courses.  
Ultimately, the hig hly theoretical nature of the Framework and deep interconnection among its frames, while beneficial 
from a philosophical perspective, presented difficulties in developing concrete lessons, particularly for the one - and two -shot sessions 
that we most common ly teach right now. The Framework itself is not a tool for classroom instruction. While our initial project goal 
was to expand our knowledge of the Framework and our bank of active learning activities, we also found that our process made 
evident the need f or a project like ours, where teaching librarians consider how to translate theory and dispositions into activities 
and lessons that are meaningful and applicable for their specific student needs and institutional settings.  
-ACTIVATING THE ACRL  FRAMEWORK : ACTIVE LEARNING …- LOEX -2021       11 RESULTS AND WHERE WE ARE NOW 
In March 2021, we published a “Perspectives on the Framework” column in College and Research Libraries News . The 
article provided us a chance to summarize our work and outline where we wish to go with this initiative in the future. We als o 
believed that other  librarians would benefit from learning about how we wrestled with the theoretical aspects of the Framework and 
found ways to turn those sections into active classroom lessons.  
 In addition to our article, Rusk, after leaving UDC and taking a position at S an Francisco State University (SFSU), drew 
on this work in the development of a Teaching Research Toolkit ( https://libguides.sfsu.edu/toolkit ). The toolkit is a faculty -facing 
resource that compiles activities which faculty c an download and use in their classes. Several of the activities included in the toolkit 
stemmed directly from our Framework discussions , including the previously discussed evaluating sources activity ( “Authority is 
Constructed and Contextual ”), two activit ies tied to “Scholarship as Conversation, ” a matrix activity to support students conducting 
literature reviews, and an activity to support synthesizing sources. While the toolkit is organized into four main categories  (Topics 
and Research Questions, Finding and Evaluating Sources, Reading Sources,  and Using Sources) to align with audience expectations 
and needs, the activities are rooted in the Framework. SFSU is now revisiting all of the activities and analyzing them throug h a 
Universal Design for Learning lens, to ensure that they are accessible and inclusive.  
 A more student -facing project was developed by Kowalski and Meals at UDC. They took the spring of 2020 pivot to online 
learning as a chance to create Library 101, a self -paced LMS -based tutorial. Students may ask to be enrolled or can be e nrolled at 
their professor’s request. Library 101 contains numerous modules covering all aspects of library and research skills, includi ng videos 
developed from the Framework project. Kowalski and Meals plan to add more modules, and more advanced modules w ith the goal 
of possibly turning the organization into a required, credit -bearing course.  
 Rusk’s departure for SFSU now presents the UDC library with the opportunity to onboard a new Information Literacy 
Librarian. Discussing the work the librarian team d id on this project, along with the outcomes, will support our incoming new hire 
in learning about the library’s culture of collaboration and approach to teaching, and will provide them with some activities  to use  
in the classroom right away. The incoming l ibrarian will also be responsible for coordinating strategic planning for the growth and 
curricular integration of our information literacy instruction program, and we expect that the project outcomes will provide a strong 
foundation for our new librarian’ s planning process. Eventually, the UDC library hopes that information literacy and research skills 
will be integrated into more classes and scaffolded into the curriculum at all levels. Such scaffolding might open up space f or us to 
incorporate the more a dvanced activities identified and developed during our Framework analysis.  
 Additionally, in a prime example of how we as a team are always creating more work for ourselves because of our 
enthusiasm for new ideas, we have discussed furthering our work by s tudying how our process could be adapted by other institutions. 
We want to look at what would be needed to scale this for larger organizations or for different teaching contexts, like K -12 or 
certificate programs. Our process in this project was just that —ours, based on our own context and capacity —but we believe the 
general concept of an in -depth team review of the Framework and its potential applications to the classroom, however it makes sense 
to implement it in a given institution, would be widely benef icial.  
 Finally, we continue to develop activity ideas. One fun result we hope to achieve is to create an OER resource based on 
Superfight. Superfight is an Apples to Apples -style card game where participants create fighters from two sets of cards —charact ers 
and attributes —and then argue why their character would win in a fight. The idea for this game came about during our discussion of 
the “Authority is Constructed and Contextual” and “Information Has Value” frames. Our version of the game would create sc enarios 
of research and ask students to pit their cards of sources, author authorities, and attributes ( e.g., article is 100 years old, source is 
online, results are not statistically significant) against one other to see who could create the best source f or the scenario.

A FEW KIND, BUT TRUE WORDS : USING THE RESEARCH 
CONSULTATION TO EMPOWER MARGINALIZED GRAD 
STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH IMPOSTER SYNDROME  
V. DOZIER  
 The University of San Diego (USD) is a private, contemporary Catholic, predominantly White institution (PWI) in San 
Diego, California, with approximately 9,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. USD’s estimated master’s and 
doctoral student tuition is about $51,000 annually. The School of Leadership and Educa tional Sciences (SOLES) services 
approximately 1,000 graduate students. SOLES’ demographics and diversity statistics largely reflects USD’s racial, ethnic, an d other 
demographics, except for its Education for Social Justice (SJEd) education specialist and doctoral program, the most racially and 
ethnically diverse program at SOLES. This description provides context for both the assumed and real privilege at USD, in whi ch 
graduate students are assumed to be White, Catholic, heteronormative, with upper middle class or higher socioeconomic status. 
However, in programs like SJEd, those assumed privileges are more likely to be false. The SJEd students frequently interact w ith 
the education librarian in research consultations, courses, and assistantship assignments  and regularly displayed impostor syndrome 
behavior. The education librarian’s observations of the SJEd students and their vocalized experiences of otherness and impost er 
feelings formed the foundation of this research project.  
It is within this context on e can begin to think about the privileged image of USD and other academic institutions. This 
paper also asks one to consider diversity beyond race, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation: also consider gradu ate students 
that may identify as a re ligious minority, insecurely housed, formerly incarcerated, etc.  If we as librarians and library workers claim 
to support student success and want to empower students to be their full, authentic selves, then we should be intentional abo ut 
developing and u sing strategies to support them. For librarians, the research consultation can provide one space in which to empower 
marginalized graduate students with some kind, but true words .  
IMPOSTER SYNDROME BACKGROUND  
 In 1978, psychologists Pauline Pose Clance an d Suzanne Imes coined the term “impostor phenomenon” to describe the 
observed impostor feelings experienced by highly achieving academic and professional women in their practice. Clance and Imes  
(1978)  state: 
However, despite their earned degrees, scholastic honors, high achievement on standardized tests, praise and professional 
recognition from colleagues and respected authorities, these women do not experience an internal sense of success. They 
consider thems elves to be “impostors.” Women who experience the impostor phenomenon maintain a strong belief that 
they are not intelligent; in fact they are convinced that they have fooled anyone who thinks otherwise. (p. 1)   
Clance and Imes observed women experienced i mposter feelings more than men, acknowledging that social structures and gender 
norms may contribute to why women are more prone to imposter feelings despite all indicators of success otherwise (1978, p. 2) . 
They a lso cited scholarship on the topic of success attribution, which found that women tend to attribute success the temporary luc k, 
effort, or someone else’s effort, whereas men tend to cite ability as the foundation of their success (1978, pp. 2 –3). Nearly ten years 
later, Clance and O’Toole (1987)  cited structured interview and questionnaire studies published from 1979 to 1985 finding that men 
4       LOEX -2021   -DOZIER - experience imposter feelings as m uch or more so than women, though women were more like to verbalize the feelings openly (p. 2). 
Men, in contrast, were more likely to express imposter feelings in “an anonymous and confidential setting” (Clance & O’Toole, 
1987, p. 2) . 
In 1993, Langford and Clance published a literature review in Psychotherapy  of imposter phenomenon research, theories, 
therapeutic strategies, instruments, and implications published since Clance and Imes ’ 1978 seminal publication in Psychotherapy 
Theory, Research and Practice . The literature review establishes a clear psychological interest in exploring gender dichotomies, 
attribution theories, and achievement measures amongst populations like college stu dents, educators, and professionals (Langford & 
Clance, 1993) . While the review covers a number of studies exploring the impact o f individual behavior, family impact, and gender 
on imposter phenomenon, the review fails to mention any studies that discuss the implications of historically marginalized id entities 
on imposter syndrome experiences.  
 There is a long history of scholars co nsidering the impact of imposter syndrome on those with marginalized identities. 
Harvey (1981)  contradicts early research finding noticeable impact of race and sex on imposter experiences with their findings th at 
the differences are indicators of self -perceived atypicality. Harvey’s work is itself atypical of numerous studies finding people with 
marginalized identities are more likely to experience imposter feelings related to their sense of “otherness” (Cokley et al., 2013; 
Gardner & Holley, 2011; Peteet et al., 2015; Pulliam & Gonzalez, 2018; Simon, 2020; Trotman, 2009) . Frances Trotman, a scholar 
of African American women’s counseling and therapeutic practices, states, “Black women in the United States have experienced the 
imposter phenomenon by virtue of being both black people in white America and women in a male -dominated culture” (2009, p. 
78). Mullangi and Jagsi (2019)  discuss the pervasiveness of  imposter syndrome amongst medical professionals and graduate students, 
including “how the syndrome disproportionately affects women and minority groups —who often lack sufficient role models of 
success” (p. 403).  
 Research on the imposter behaviors and ch allenges of graduate students with marginalized identities seems most plentiful 
post-2000, in which the percentages of minorities pursuing and conferred graduate degrees shows significant growth (Cokley et al., 
2013; Gardner & Holley, 2011; Parkman, 2016; Simon, 2020) . Recent National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data indicates 
degrees confe rred by race and ethnicity between academic years 2000 and 2016 : 
• Hispanic students – master’s degree – increased 191% ; doctoral degree – increased 126%  
• Black students – master’s degree – increased 129% ; doctoral degree – increased 90%  
• Asian & Pacific Isl ander students – master’s degree – 87% ; doctoral degree – increased 69%  
• American Indian & Alaska Native students – master’s degree – increased 42% ; doctoral degree – increased 15% (National 
Center for Education Statistics, 2019) . 
The increased enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in graduate and professional programs may provide a sense of improvement. 
In reality, racial, ethnic, sexual or other minorities are still greatly outnumbered by those identifying as White male or fe male, 
heterosexual, or Judeo -Christian at a PWI. This can increase the chances graduate students wi th marginalized identities may 
experience imposter feelings. Parkman (2016)  discusses imposter phenomenon’s ability to “negatively impact an organization’s 
ability to retain students, faculty, and staff alike” and “understanding imposter phenomenon can be very helpful in identifyi ng those 
at risk for leaving” (p. 51). The work of Cokley et al., (2013)  found imposter feelings was the s trongest indicator for Minority Student 
Status Stress, psychological stress and psychological well -being for African American, Asian, and Latino students at PWIs (p.89) .  
IMPOSTER SYNDROME BEHAVIORS & COMPETENCE TYPES  
 Those struggling with imposter syndro me exhibit one or more of a pattern of behaviors. One of the key findings of the 
Clance and O’Toole study states, “IP sufferers do not have a realistic sense of their own competence and are not fully empowered 
to internalize their strengths, accept their d eficits, and function with joy. If impostor feelings are intense, IP sufferers may turn down 
opportunities to advance” (1987, p. 3) . Other scholars observed similar behaviors with participants describing caree r setbacks, failure 
to advocate or accept opportunities or promotions, and downplaying or guilt about success (Clance  & Imes, 1978; Langford & 
Clance, 1993; Mullangi & Jagsi, 2019) . 
In The Secrets Thoughts of Successful Women: Why Capable People Suffer from Impostor Syndrome and How to Thrive in 
Spite of It , Valerie Young organizes imposter behaviors into five compete ncy types: the perfectionist, expert, soloist, natural genius, 
and superwoman/superman/super student. The competency types can help librarians quickly identify if their graduate student is  
exhibiting imposter behaviors and help discern strategies to empowe r the student. They describe the types as : 
-A FEW KIND, BUT TRUE WORDS : USING THE RESEARCH …- LOEX -2021       5 • The Perfectionist ’s primary focus is on “how” something is done. This includes how the work is conducted and how it 
turns out. One minor flaw in an otherwise stellar performance or 99 out of 100 equals failure and  thus shame.  
• The Expert  is the knowledge version of the Perfectionist. Here, the primary concern is on “what” and “how much” you 
know or can do. Because you expect to know everything, even a minor lack of knowledge denotes failure and shame.  
• The Soloist  cares mostly about “who” completes the task. To make it on the achievement list, it has to be you and you 
alone. Because you think you need to do and figure out everything on your own, needing help is a sign of failure that evokes 
shame.  
• The Natural Genius  also cares about “how” and “when” accomplishments happen. But for you, competence is measured 
in terms of ease and speed. The fact that you have to struggle to master a subject or skill or that you’re not able to bang o ut 
your masterpiece on the fir st try equals failure which evokes shame.  
• The Superwoman/Superman/Super Student  measures competence based on “how many” roles they can both juggle and 
excel in. Falling short in any role —as a parent, partner, on the home -front, host/hostess, friend, volunt eer—all evoke shame 
because they feel they should be able to handle it all —perfectly and easily. (Young, n.d.)   
Gardner and Holly (2011)  observed significant imposter syndrome behaviors exhibited by racial and ethnic minorities in 
the first -generation doctoral student population. They quote a Black doctoral student named Brandy discussing the lack of 
belongingness, “I’m here but I really don’t belong in terms of class, in terms of gender, in terms of race, I don’t belong” ( p. 85). 
Ryan, a Bl ack doctoral student, expressed the challenges as, “Those invisible barriers are real. People can’t see them, but they’re 
real” (p.77). Similarly Cokely et al. (2013)  imply how otherness and pervasive negative stereotypes adversely impact Black students’ 
ability to adjust to PWIs more in comparison to other ethnic minorities (p. 90). They also found Asian American experience impostor 
syndrome at higher rates than Black or Latino(a) American students due to “the cultural pressures of high parental expectatio ns and 
the unique stressor of being the model minority” and are more likely to exhibit perfectio nist tendencies despite overall positive 
academic stereotypes (Cokley et al., 2013, p. 91) . 
THE EMPOWERING RESEARCH CONSULTATION  
 Over the years, I adapted recommendations and strategies from imposter phenomenon research, marginalized populations 
research, higher education and academic library research, and my own observations to incorporate intentional checkpoints to 
empower marginalized graduate students as they struggle through impostor syndrome, minority stress, library anxiety, and a ho st of 
other challenges. Gregory and Higgins argue that librarians, when appl ying a critical perspective in their work, consider the historical, 
cultural, social, economic, and political forces that interact with information in order to critique, disrupt, and interrogat e these forces 
(Gregory & Higgins, 2013, as cited in Garcia, 2015) . As a Black female academic librarian in a predominately White fie ld working 
at a PWI, my critical librarianship efforts are intentional acts to help shape a genuinely inclusive and supportive higher ed ucation 
environment, particularly for marginalized students, faculty, and staff.  
Garcia states, “Information is not neut ral, thus the way that information is presented by librarians adds meaning and context 
for students. There is a power and privilege in the ways in which information is presented and processed by instructors and s tudents” 
(2015, para. 3) . Research consultations present academic librarians with the opportunity to engage graduate students in one -on-one 
or small group learning. Lee (2004)  states, “The goal of the research  consultation service is to empower the client with both the skills 
necessary to accomplish his or her research objective and to educate the client on information resources available in both pr int and 
electronic formats” (p. 170). My research consultations  range from thirty minutes to an hour, with the first five to ten minutes 
dedicated to check -ins in which we chat about recent events, challenges, and presents the first opportunity to empower the student 
with my genuine interest in their well -being and in terests. Throughout the consultation, I pause to check for understanding and 
empower my students to critically think about their project and the support or challenges they face. My graduate students oft en 
engaged in personal, self - or community -reflective research, and those with marginalized identities express more concern about the 
potential impact of their work on the communities. With marginalized graduate students, I have observed it is even more impor tant 
to affirm their interests and build rapport an d trust before providing constructive feedback because their interests are more likely to 
be personally important to them. Imposter syndrome can add an extra barrier to the students feeling empowered to pursue or st ick 
with their topics or populations of i nterest, especially if the topics are not considered research -worthy or interesting to the White 
faculty or their White graduate peers.  
Sample strategies for observed impostor syndrome intervention points and kind words to use:  
• Perfectionist  fretting abou t APA formatting mistakes —Remind them everyone  makes formatting errors and citation styles 
are constantly evolving to acknowledge new or different resources. Affirm correct examples to demonstrate success.  
6       LOEX -2021   -DOZIER - • Expert apologizing for lack of knowledge about a m inority -focused research theory, framework, or methodology (e.g., 
intersectionality, critical Latinx/o/a theory, or critical Indigenous methodologies) —Discuss the prioritization of Western, 
White, English -language, and often male -dominated resources and th e underrepresentation of non -Western, White, English -
language, or male resources. Become more familiar with minority -centering resources so that one is ready to support student 
information needs.  
• Soloist  hesitant to collaborate with group project for fear of being labeled intellectually inferior to their peers —Remind 
them they are all graduate students in positions of learning and growing. Ask the student to consider what strengths they 
bring to the group dynamic.  
• Natural Genius refusing to accept a researc h opportunity for fear of failure —Offer to provide research support and sessions 
to discuss research concerns that the student may feel uncomfortable revealing to supervising faculty. As confidence builds, 
point out success and growth points.  
• Superwoman/Su perman/Super Student  over-whelmed with academic and research projects for fear of being stereotyped 
lazy or unworthy —Acknowledge their struggle and offer strategies to prioritize project on a research agenda. Remind them 
that everything does not have to ha ppen simultaneously to prove worthiness . 
CONCLUSION  
 Studies have shown that imposter syndrome impacts people across ages, races, ethnicities, socioeconomic status, and other 
identities, and those with traditionally marginalized identities are more prone t o experience negative effects in White or male -
dominated environments. Some higher education institutions have implemented or are developing programs to address campus 
climate, belongingness, imposter feelings, and other issues for students, faculty, and s taff. Academic librarians are in a unique 
position to address graduate student’s imposter feelings in the research consultation, by adding empowering invention points when 
impostor behaviors are observed. Infusing critical librarianship with cultural compe tency, anti -bias, and anti -racism strategies can 
help academic librarians be better prepared to recognize and address the nuances of how and why graduate students with margin alized 
identities experience imposter syndrome. Thus, we can provide better academ ic and research support to these students .

AGENDA -SETTING : WHAT A MEDIA EFFECTS THEORY CAN 
ADD TO INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION  
NATE FLOYD  AND  JACLYN SPRAETZ  
INTRODUCTION  
  While fake news remains an important issue, it often overshadows the more subtle ways news media influence its audience. 
In this paper , the authors address this oversight by introducing the agenda -setting theory of mass communication as a classroom 
activit y for information literacy instruction. Agenda -setting helps explain the relationship between the presentation of the news and 
public opinion. It suggests the media do not tell us what to think but do tell us what to think about. This paper present s the va lue of 
teaching media effects theories in information literacy classes and outline s a lesson plan on agenda -setting. The ultimate goal of this 
lesson is to empower students to think critically about the news media ecosystem.  
SUMMER OF THE SHARK  
Summer of the Shark began with an 8 -year-old boy who was attacked by a shark in July of 2001. Perhaps this story gained 
so much media attention because of its gruesome details. Jesse Arbogast was standing in shallow water when a 200 -pound bull shark 
attack ed. Arbogast suffered horrific injuries. The attack sparked a media firestorm and led the news media to focus on shark attack s 
for the rest of the summer. The summer of 2001 became known as the Summer of the Shark when media coverage of shark attacks 
becam e the third most covered news story on ABC, NBC, and CBS until the September 11th attacks ( Eisman, 2003).   
While the news made many people fearful of sharks and left a lasting impression, it was a typical year in terms of shark 
attacks. According to the In ternational Shark Attack File, there were fewer attacks in 2001 than there were in 2000 worldwide --76 
attacks in 2001 compared to 89 in 2000.   In hindsight, Summer of the Shark has been criticized as an example of fear mongering 
and exaggeration (Stossel &  Jaquez, 2007; Broad, 2001). It illustrates how legitimate news can misinform its audience, causing the 
public to believe an issue is more important than it actually is.  
FAKE NEWS VS . REAL NEWS 
Despite many examples of legitimate media organizations sensa tionalizing the news, media and information literacy efforts 
continue to focus on the harm of fake news. We argue that not enough attention is paid to how real news can misinform its aud ience. 
Research suggests that Americans do not read as much fake news as suspected and it is only a small fraction of their total media 
consumption (Nyhan, 2020). Through analyzing Twitter data, Grinberg et al. (2019) found that 1% of users were exposed to 80% of 
fake news and that only .1% of users were responsible for shar ing 80% of fake news. Additionally, Americans’ consumption of fake 
news has declined since the 2016 election and,  according to  recent data, fake news made up only 0.7% of their total news diet (Guess 
et al., 2018, p. 3). In fact, more misperceptions occur due to political figures and elites sharing misinformation in mainstream news 
than through blatant fake news (Nyhan, 2020, p. 227).   
Often, being misinformed can be attributed to intuitive thinking rather than analytical thinking (Nyhan, 2020, p. 225). For  
example, the media’s focus on shark attacks during the summer of 2001 was so effective because many of us have an inherent fe ar 
of sharks. Individuals inherently afraid of sharks who relied on their intuition when trying to make sense of the risk of sha rk attacks 
14       LOEX -2021   -FLOYD AND SPRAETZ - were easily led astray. In our lesson on agenda -setting, we aim to get students to think analytically when encountering news stories. 
While librarians direct students to use mainstream news for research projects, we often do not provide them with specific tools to 
read news stories analytically. Media effects offer a solution to this problem by providing students with a specific resource  to use 
when reading news stories.    
MEDIA EFFECTS  
 Walter Lippmann suggested the power of media effects in his 1 922 book, Public Opinion . Lippmann was a prolific writer 
and public intellectual in the inter -war period. In his book, he considered the disconnect between what he called the world outside 
and the pictures in our head. How do we know what we think we know about the world, he wondered. Lippmann knew that the real 
world was too complex and too remote for us to manage. He argued that the media helped create the pictures in our heads. Year s 
later, in the aftermath of World War II, scholars in psychology, sociol ogy, and political science developed the field of mass 
communication and set out to study and document the effects of media messages. Media effects are “social or psychological 
responses occurring in individuals as a result of exposure to or processing of or otherwise acting on media messages” (Tsfati, 2011). 
These effects can be intended or unintended on the part of the message producer.  
Perse and Lambe (2016) outline three important types of media effects in their book Media Effects and Society . They 
describe affective media effects, behavioral media effects, and cognitive media effects. Affective media effects are concerned wi th 
the “formation of attitudes, or positive or negative evaluations about something” (Perse and Lambe, 2016, p. 3). In the conte xt of 
marketing, scholars might ask questions about the audience’s emotional reaction to an advertising campaign. Behavioral media 
effects are concerned with documenting a link between behavior and exposure to media messages (Perse and Lambe, 2016). In the  
context of video games, scholars might ask questions about a link between violent behavior and exposure to violent video games.  
Cognitive media effects are concerned with “the acquisition of information —what people learn, how much do they learn, how needs 
for information are satisfied or not” (Perse and Lambe, 2016, p. 3). In the context of health communication, researchers might ask 
whether an anti -smoking campaign adequately informs the public. In the context of political communication, researchers might as k 
whether or how news stories can influence public opinion.  
MEDIA EFFECTS : AGENDA -SETTING THEORY OF MASS COMMUNICATION  
Agenda -setting is a cognitive media effect that helps explain the relationship between the presentation of news content and 
public  opinio n (McQuail, 2010). It is concerned with how we learn, and what we learn about political issues. Agenda -setting 
addresses the disconnect between the world outside and the pictures in our heads that Walter Lippmann discussed . Max McCombs 
and Donald Shaw (1972) built on Lippmann’s ideas in their 1968 study of voters in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. McCombs and 
Shaw demonstrated that journalists prioritize issues for voters by presenting the news in a way that the audience attaches im portance 
to some issues, but  not others . 
Agenda -setting suggests the media indicate to the public the main issues of the day through the presentation of news. When 
readers look at a news source, they learn not only about a given issue, but also “how much importance to attach to that issue from 
the amount of information in a news story and the position of the news story” (McCombs & Shaw, 1972, p. 176). The issues appearing 
most frequently and receiving the most space or attention are characterized as the media agenda. The media’s abili ty to dictate which 
issues are most important is at the heart of agenda -setting theory.  
To determine the media agenda for a specific publication, or a collection of publications, researchers use content analysis 
to count and quantify the issues as they app ear in the media. The issues can be rank -ordered based on how much information is given 
about an issue, and where it is positioned in the newspaper or broadcast. Researchers expect to see some level of corresponde nce 
between the order of importance given i n the media to issues (media agenda) and the order of significance attached to the same 
issues by individuals (public agenda . Agenda -setting’s big idea is that the media do not tell you what to think, but they do tell you 
what to think about (McQuail, 2010).  
THE LESSON PLAN 
The purpose of the agenda -setting lesson plan is to help students look at how news stories are prioritized  by different 
sources. The lesson allows students to reflect on their media usage and how media effects impact them, including both reflect ive and 
active learning activities to help students make connections between their own personal use of news media as well as the production 
of news.  
At the beginning of the lesson students will independently answer the questions, “What are the issues that are most important  
to you?” and “What are your top news sources?” Once students have had time to answer these questio ns, they will respond on a 
-AGENDA -SETTING : WHAT A MEDIA EFFECTS THEORY CAN ADD…- LOEX -2021       15 Padlet with the top 3 -5 news stories they believe are the most important current issues. Once students have shared their responses 
they will be asked why they believe the issues they wrote down are the most important issues.   
After the group discussion, the librarian will do a mini -lecture on agenda -setting, providing a definition as well as examples 
of agenda -setting in different contexts, such as broadcast news, news feeds, and news websites.   
In the next part of the lesson, stu dents will have the opportunity to practice looking at agenda -setting in groups and reflect 
on their personal news feeds. During the first activity, students will look at positioning and space that news stories take u p on 
newspaper front pages that we will  provide to them using sources like  The New York Times , Los Angeles Times , and Chicago Tribune . 
Depending on if the session is in -person or online, students will use color ed pencils or an online tool to outline the space devoted to 
various news stories on the newspapers’ front pages. After looking at the position and space of news stories, students will do a think, 
pair, share to compare what the prominent issues look like in their newspapers.  
In the second activity, students will be asked to look at the ne ws sources or news feeds they typically go to and count the 
topics presented. Students’ choice in this activity is important since we want students to reflect on where they find their n ews and 
what topics are prioritized. It is also important to show that agenda -setting does not just happen in newspapers but is present in all 
news media. After students count their top news stories they will compare them with the newspaper front pages shared in the f irst 
activity. This activity will help students reflect on what news they typically see and what news stories may be missing in their news 
feeds. At the end of this lesson, students will reflect on the activities by reflecting on how their knowledge of agenda -setting can 
help them read news in the future.    
STUDEN T LEARNING GOALS  
The learning outcomes for the lesson include: 1) Students will be able to explain agenda -setting and how they can apply 
their knowledge of agenda -setting when consulting news sources; and 2) Students will be able to articulate how news sto ries 
influence them personally. It is important that students gain knowledge of agenda -setting, but we also want them  to understand media 
effects in general and how readers are influenced by the news. This lesson benefits from active learning and helping s tudents practice 
analytical thinking rather than intuitive thinking, guides students to reflect on their media diets, and adds nuance to a com plex issue. 
Our ultimate goal is to give students a real tool they can use to critically read and engage with news  stories.  
CONCLUSION  
Although fighting fake news remains an important issue, we argue that library teachers need to do more to help students 
understand the media effects of mainstream news. Our lesson plan on agenda -setting introduces the basics of content  analysis, a 
methodological tool that offers students a way to critically engage with news stories. Looking at the amount of space devoted  to a 
news story as well as how it is positioned can help determine  the priorities of  a particular news source. To bor row from Walter 
Lippmann, we want students to get to “the world outside” and understand that news sources prioritize issues differently. Intr oducing 
students to agenda -setting theory and teaching them how to apply it when interacting with news stories push es students to reflect on 
how they consume news. It emboldens them to do the cognitive work of understanding how news stories are produced and 
disseminated.

INTRODUCTION  
 Like most higher education institutions, Wayne State University faced unprecedented challenges with the onset of the 
COVID -19 pandemic in March 2020. Our campus, located in the midtown cultural center of Detroit, transitioned most courses and 
services to remote learning on March 16, 2020. This included shutting our Library doors and shifting our focus to virtual instruction, 
servi ces, and research support. Happily, we were able to reopen for limited library access and on -site services on September 1, 2020.  
 The continual shifting policies and limitations relating to COVID -19 protoc ols impacted almost every area of our work, 
creati ng layers and layers of decision -making and the need for quick, conscientious action . According to Jackson and McKerg ow, 
solutions -focused thinking works to highlight strengths over deficits, and is best when this approach is focused on interactions 
between people, emphasizes small changes, and recognizes that each situation is different ( 2007 ). A solutions -focus can be fostered 
by emph asizing  questions such as:  
• What do you want as an outcome?  
• Are we seeing this solution takin g place?  
• Under what circumstances , are you seeing this solution ? 
• How can we do more of that?  
• What small changes can we make?  
 In recent years, o ur library system  invested in being strengths -based  with many of our staff participating in Clifton 
StrengthsFinder (https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/strengthsfinder.aspx ) and a year -long, system -wide leadership se ries 
which complemented this work. In facing the challenge s of the COVID -19 pandemic , we utilized these skills further by  adopting a 
solutions -focused mindset  which  enabled us to remain efficient and focused on action.  
We present four challenges where we successfully engaged in a solutions -focused approach . 
SOLUTION #1 – COVID  FAQ  
 The response to the COVID crisis quickly and dramatically changed our campus. During the initial closures, information 
and guidelines were so metimes changing hourly.  Our existing lines of communication, such as e -mail, or sharing new policy at a 
meeting, w ere no longer adequate to respond to the constantly shifting landscape. In addition, our staff and users were desperate for 
accurate informat ion—it was difficult to kn ow who had the “right” answer at any given time. We needed to develop a quick and 
responsive system that could capture the correct information and make it available to everyone. The paradigm had shifted from one 
of “information di ssemination” to “ information capture .” 
   
 
18       LOEX -2021  -BIELAT AND ROUAN -  Our library system licenses LibAnswers, through which we manage our email  reference service. LibAnswers includes an 
FAQ, which allows staff with access to create question & answer pairs on the fly. Entered pairs and revisions are available in real 
time, there is no need to wait for overnight server uploads. This system also allows the creation of different groups of answers, where 
permissions can be set for viewing. LibAnswers provided a way to maintain one central lo cation for retrieving the most current 
policies, procedures and information resulting from the library system’s response to the COVID closure. We created a publicly 
accessible group titled “Library Support During COVID -19' (https://ask.lib.wayne.edu/covid -19) and included 20 question/answer 
pairs specifically addressing library services and information on campus r esources. We also added 18 questions to our Internal FAQs, 
with access limited to library staff. The process to add or change information in LibAnswers is simple, and our staff  informally 
communicated with a small management team when information  had been changed or a question/answer pair added to the system . 
We woul d also send an email to our all staff listserv to notify and link them to a question/answer pair in the FAQ, enforcing the us e 
of the FAQ a s the authoritative source of up -to-date information.  
 The use of our FAQs increased by 185% , measuring a March -to-March time period, from 4,735 hits on our entire FAQs 
inventory to 13,518, almost 50% of which were recorded views of the 20 questions in our COVID -FAQ group. Our top three  accessed 
questions were all  related to circulation . 
By changing our perspective of this challenge, we stopped trying to create more communication channels and instead 
focused on finding an easy, accessible, flexible , already -existing system for capturing information, without imposing an approval 
proces s and encouraged our colleagues to share updated information in one place.   
SOLUTION #2 – CANVAS COURSE MODULE  
 When you have been a  subject specialist librarian for a decade and built a strong relationship with a department, it can be 
easy for both sides to fall into routine. This was the case with our course integrated instruction for PSY 3993 – Laboratory in 
Experimental Psychology.  PSY 3993 , a required course for Psychology majors, benefitted from  in-person instruction by a librarian 
every semester for up to twelve sections. Previously, the Psychology department had delivered asynchronous instruction on scholarly 
literature searchin g via a lengthy PowerPoint presentation that students would read through in their own time. This delivery was less 
than ideal  and any subsequent conversations around asynchronous instruction were met with significant hesitation. Furthermore, the 
long-time lead instruct or for PSY 3993 , a strong library advocate,  was retiring in August 2020 and the future of this course integrated 
instruction was to be determined by new instructo r.  
 Our Libraries ’ acquisition of LibWizard in early 2020  provided a n accessible , flexible tool for the development of 
asynchronous instruction content. In fact, the PSY 3993 content was used as an example  to demonstrate the poss ibilities of the new 
platform. This example was improved and sent to the two PSY 3993 lead instru ctors to proactively illustrate the potential to deliver 
this instruction effectively and interactively  in the virtual learning environment. Both instructors offered their support after viewing 
the sample module  and actively engaged in further development.  The final product , a combination of the LibWizard tutorial, a quiz 
to self -check learning, and a Qualtrics feedback form , was packaged into a Canvas course module  which was imported into each 
section of PSY 3993.  
 Every semester, the feedback is compiled  and shared  with the lead instructor, along with proactive plans for improvements. 
Upon completion of the tutorial, PSY 3993 students  overwhelmingly indicate that the tutorial  helps them (1) find scholarly articles 
in a database and (2) use database tools to limit searches for the types of information they want . In the future, most students indicate 
they will  (1) look for information in new or different places and (2) use a library guide on their general topic to help them get started . 
Two-thirds of the st udents rate the tutorial as “very useful” or “extremely useful .” 
 Utilizing  the resources at hand  and embracing the unexpected remote learning situation , we were able change the 
conversation around PSY 3993 from problem -based to one that allowed for a more  sustainable set of communication and instruction 
delivery  to this important course.  
SOLUTION #3 – REINVENT THE SERVICE  
 As we prepared to open our physical doors for the fall of 2020, we were confronted with complex  decisions around what 
services to offer  and how to deliver them. Our campus community was sending clear messaging that the y expect ed an  in-person 
reference presence at our Undergraduate Library. How were we going to reconcile that with the strict COVID precautions in place 
on our campus? And ho w would an in -person service work in the redesigned -for-COVID Undergraduate Library space?  
  We formed a working group with the goal of  reproduc ing our reference desk in the virt ual environment via Zoom. This 
drop-in service was offered via a kiosk in our Undergraduate Library, located not far from our single service desk but in a space that 
allowed for social distancing. Students could approach the kiosk , launch the personal Zoom room which served as our virtual 
   
 
-CREATE , CHECK , COMEBACK : USING A SOLUTIONS -BASED APPROACH …- LOEX -2021       19 reference desk , and speak with a librarian face -to-face. This pilot service launched in mid -September and proved to be unsuccessful. 
No one made use of our kiosk. Our chat reference statistics were higher than ever, and our  building was seeing over 100 visitors 
each day.  After giving the service three weeks to develop, it was clear a change was needed.  
While cautious about  demand, w e want ed to support the work of our on -site colleagues. W e made the decision to open the  
Zoom virtual reference desk  for off -site use. In mid -October, advertisements for the service began appearing on our library homepage 
and social media  accounts . Our users began using our Zoom desk  and we were  open for business.  
 Revisiting the service in Dec ember, we saw our original hours (11am -3pm) , conceived to match the most popular 
reservations time for library building use,  no longer aligned with peak library service demands. We shifted our hours at the start of 
2021 to 1 -5pm and within a few weeks saw the 4 -5pm hour become our busiest of the service. Our Zoom reference desk is growing 
in popularity  and provides more accessi ble access to librarians than appointment -based research consultations . In fact, a pproximately 
two-thirds  of our Zoom reference questions fall into the extended reference category  which indicates  librarian s are provid ing longer 
and more in -depth research a ssistance than we  previously had through our physical reference desk service.  
 We even found a way to repackage the service when students shared their desire to have a “place” to gather and work on 
research papers with staff available for assistance. Our Zoom reference desk was opened for additional hours and branded as our 
Research Paper Refuge . Faculty have taken notice and are referring  students . Building these services off of one another and using 
our successes to drive decisions for small change has  resulted in larger and more lasting impact on the future trajectory of our 
research support services.  
SOLUTION #4 – REPACKAGE AND PUSH 
Our 2020 fall semester, like most higher education institutions, was fully online. As time wore on, librarians became more 
concerned about our new freshmen, transfer and graduate students, and their engagement and understanding of library resources and 
services. Traditionally, our new student orientation i ncluded a fun, engaging game that introduced students to our resources  and 
services , and the people who staffed our library. This activity always received high ratings, a long with enthusiastic comments from 
student participants about how comfortable and confident they felt about using the libraries. Although our staff had created a robust 
information page regarding using the libraries under COVID -19 restrictions , along with two short LibWizard tutorials to introduce 
students to t he libraries, we were not sure if our new est students were engaging with them. In addition to this challenge , most courses 
had been moved to online, asynchronous formats. As a result, the only library integration in many courses that traditionally had in -
person  instruction relied on faculty facilitating library instruction materials  integrated into the Canvas LMS.  
From a campus perspective, basic library information dissemination was also significantly impacted, as new student 
welcome and orientation activ ities were asynchronous and , in many cases, optional. Many students had never been to campus . Even 
though the libraries were open to a limited capacity, several  students we spoke with expressed reticence  to come on campus and use 
the libraries, as they wer e unfamiliar with the location, the environment, and the required procedures to visit the libraries in -person. 
By late fall semester, w e realized we did not need to create new guides, resources or services, but needed to find a repackage our 
existing content and push it out to our students . 
A small team  began to consider how we could accomplish this in a fun and engaging way . In 2014, Buzzfeed’s social media 
quizzes logged over 100 million users. O ur library’s Instagram feed has over 1,000 followers. They may not all be our students, but 
it was a place to start. How could we leverage the popularity of social media quizzes with the ability to push content throug h our 
Instagram feed? We started with t he idea of  creating an online quiz to gather basic information about a n individual  student’s study 
habits, interests and academic goals, and use their response s to create a personalized list library resources and services that aligned 
with their responses.   
We identified eleven library services and resources we felt were critical to new students. Using our institutional Qualtrics  
account, we created a logic -based  quiz that asked simple questions , using “I” statements to personalize  (Figure 1) . When completed, 
students were presented with a screen of library resource and service recommendations, and were also sent an email of the same 
content, which  aligned with statements  to which  they responded “ Definitely  Yes” and “Probably Yes”  (Figure 2) . This was branded 
as our Research Personality Quiz . Our beta testers provided very positive feedback . The Quiz was pushed out through our Instagram , 
university portal and directly to our Student Success program leaders. By re imagining how we could engage with  students, we  
created a  fun and fast way to introduce students to the library’s services and resources.

CONCLUSION  
By using a solutions -focused approach to these four challenges, our staff was able to reframe the overwhelming challeng es 
presented by COVID related to communication and library engagement. Instead of focusing on the problems and the roadblocks 
ahead of us, we considered what was already working.  We focused on the positive aspects —dedicated and creative staff along with 
robust array of synchronous and asynchronous  tools —and how  to best leverage these assets.  This perspective gave us the confidence 
to implement new ideas that were not grand in scale, but had significant, positive impacts on our users and staff.

CRISIS TEACHING & ACTIVE LEARNING :  
BEYOND THE PANDEMIC  
HEATHER ADAIR AND ASHLEY B. CRANE  
INTRODUCTION  
When crisis forces a change to the learning environment, instructors shift into crisis teaching. Transformation born of 
necessity, instructors are forced to quickly investigate and employ new and different instructional strategies and tools. While the 
global COVID -19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on crisis teaching, educators and librarians have a long tradition of meeting 
challenges precipitated by crises in smaller communities for as long as education has existed. Successful crisis teachin g has shown 
it is important to know the learners, build community, and maintain mutual high expectations between learners and instructors . In 
these pandemic times, the struggle becomes how to marry crisis teaching with strategic information literacy skills . Immediate 
availability and abundance of information, coupled with the mental strain of existing in a time of crisis, limits the learner ’s ability to 
filter the deluge and restricts their ability to make meaningful connections. One way to address the stru ggle is to integrate active 
learning into instruction. Active learning moves learners from a passive learning scenario to active engagement  in the learning 
process. Active learning augments  crisis teaching because it has shown to encourage development of c ommunity, collaboration, 
critical thinking, and significantly enhances learner and instructor engagement.  Because the pandemic has precipitated one of the 
longest wide -spread period s of crisis teaching, those practices adopted and proven effective during t his time will frame future 
instructional practices. It is imperative that librarians in their role as instructors learn and incorporate highly -effective teaching 
methods, like active learning, into their regular instructional practice.  
This interactive LOE X 202 1 conference session introduced participants to  the principles of crisis teaching , expose d how  
active learning and strategic information literacy instruction can be used to meet the needs of diverse learners and instructors , and 
discussed how practice s adopted and proven effective during the pandemic will frame future instruction. Participants were invited 
to consider various crises  to identify the possible needs of learners and instructors , then determine and explain why an active learning 
strategy mi ght or might not fit those ne eds. 
For the purposes of this article, the term instructor  will be used to refer to traditional teaching faculty as well as librarians  
and information professionals , whom the authors view as teaching professionals . Similarly, the term learner  will refer to traditional 
students as well as others participating in the role of a learner.  
CONTEXTUALIZING CRISES  
In order to explore the concept of crisis teaching  and its intersection with strategic information literacy ins truction and 
active learning , one must first understand what a crisis is.  A crisis is “ an event or situation that arises suddenly or reaches a tipping 
point in its severity that significantly disrupts lives and that may have long -term, harmful consequences  on individuals or groups ” 
(Taylor , 2020 ). These unexpected events create  instability and uncertainty from what was familiar, predictable, and controllable, 
with such severity  that they may be experienced as trauma  (Imad, 2020 ; Taylor, 2020). They trigger an immediate need to act 
decisively in the hope damage can be minimized  (Taylor, 2020) . 
24       LOEX -2021   -ADAIR AND CRANE - Crises are  typically experienced in two ways, communally or individually. Communal crises  are experienced by a 
community and can happen on a  local, national, or international scale. They c an affect uninvolved person s based on the magnitude 
or scale of the event and individuals ’ shared  identities  (Chick,  2013 ; Huston & DiPietro, 2007) . Examples include the global COVID -
19 pandemic, 9/11 terrorist attacks , Hurricane Katrina, and the Virginia Tech  shooting  (Foster, 2006) . Individual crises are 
experienced on a personal level  (Taylor, 2020).  They are often hidden and affect a limited group of people. Examples include parental 
divorce,  mental health  deterioration , financial issues, or sexual assault.  
CRISIS TEACHING  
In times of crisis, whether communal or individual, instructors  shift from their everyday instructional practices into crisis 
teaching. A transformation born of necessity , crisis teaching  (CT) forces instructors to investigate, adapt, and employ new 
instructional strategies and educational tools in a short period of time with little training or support.  The prolonged pandemic has 
exposed CT to the world as instructors work ed to ensure learners are growing and succeeding. It is important to note that instructors 
have long met challenges precipitated by crises (Foster, 2006) . Consider  refugee camps, war-torn countries, home or school  fires, or 
loss of a beloved instructor . Learning doesn’t stop, instruction is instead modified to reflect the  following principles of CT. 
Be Aware  
Be aware of what may be happening in the community and cognizant  of micro -communities and the potential impact  on 
learners , fellow instructors , and yourself . Adopting a pedagogy that rec ognizes  learners’ past and present experiences, reflecting on 
one’s own or others’ humanity in similar scenarios , and being aware of current events enables instructors to provide safe, empowered, 
and connected learning environments (Chick , 2013; Imad , 2020b).  
Do Something  
A 2007 survey of college students who had experienced communal and individual crises revealed that learners prefer their 
instructors “do something ” (Chick 2013) ; that is, don’t sweep the elements of the crisis  under the rug. The s pecificity of “something” 
is not important as it can be tailored to the uniqueness and scope of the situation . Learners —and instructor s—need the space for 
decompression, community, and sense making.  
Know Your Learners  
By being aware of current events, instructors can anticipate learners ’ needs  in a crisis  (Foster , 2006) . Reaching beyond 
simple contextual awareness to d eveloping relationships, even in the short -term, eases learners’ anxiety and promotes learning  
(Ravitch , 2020) . A phrase often attributed to author John C. Maxwell is [lea rners]  don’t care what you know until they know you 
care.  Teaching, especially in times of cris is, is as much about care -taking as it is about instruction.  
Build Community  
Enveloped in but not an automatic byproduct of the first three principles of CT, building community takes intention . This 
is certainly the case in a suddenly virtual environment t hat has since transitioned in and out of hybrid and flexible instructional 
scenarios. An individual's need for connectedness , especially during extended times of isolation  and prolonged uncertainty , enable s 
learners and instructors to embark on a shared purpose ( Foster , 2006; Imad , 2020b) . 
Mind the Cognitive Load  
In a crisis, learners’ cognitive processes are distracted by the immediacy, stress, and uncertainty of the event  (Chick , 2013; 
Johnson , 2020) . Structurin g learning tasks that are succinct and purposeful, and eliminating overly complex material, enables 
instructors to efficiently push new knowledge through learners’ working memory for long  term retention.  
Maintain Mutual High Expectations  
In a crisis, individuals yearn for structure  and clarity . Providing clear expectations echoes a sense of normalcy , 
predictability , and security  (Johnson 2020 ; Ravitch 2020 ). Expectations are not solely what the instructor s expect  of learners, but 
also the instructors ’ expectations  of themselves and learners’  of instructor s and their peers. Conversation around “what do you need 
from me ...” and mindfulness of the preceding principles provides a platform for communicating needs and e xpectations  (Foster , 
2006) . 
 
-CRISIS TEACHING & ACTIVE LEARNING : BEYOND THE PANDEMIC - LOEX -2021       25 IDENTIFYING LEARNER & INSTRUCTOR NEEDS  
Focus in higher education is often placed on esteem and achievement, with emphasi s on research, publication, and academic 
prowess.  According to Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs  (1943), an individual’s basic  needs must be met before they are 
motivated to accomplish more lofty , aspirational  goals.  
Maslow’s theory of human motivation [Figure 1] rests on a foundation of physiological  needs : food, water, shelter, and 
warmth. Once these are met, an individual  innately shifts to fulfilling their need for security, safety, and provid ing for sustenance.  
Likewise, p rogress up the pyramid continues toward belonging, esteem , and self-actualization  as lower needs are met .

93a0 -45c3 -9cbc -2cefd46e68cc@10.16 .  or https://openstax.org/books/psychology/pages/1 -2-history -of-psychology#term19  
The pandemic initiated an almost immediate crumbling of individual’s lower two, if not three, tiers.  Ignoring the mounting 
uncertainty, even with hopefulness and optimism for a s hort duration and speedy recovery , was unrealistic. The crisis's byproducts  
quickly stretched into personal and professional lives , shifting focus to addressing  more basal  needs while struggl ing to maintain a 
sense of normalcy  (Imad , 2020a , 2020b ). When foundational  needs are not met or are in flux, the individual is distracted and, 
consciously or not, focused on fulfillin g those needs  (Ravitch , 2020) . Naturally, these concerns heighten learners’ and instructors’ 
anxiety and take priority over esteem , self -actualization  and education . 
Needs  of Learners and Instructors  
 For many, being in class offers sanctuary , routine , and community (Imad , 2020 a). When instruction and support services 
instantaneously shifted to an online environment , instructors and learners were forced to find ways to reimagine the social 
connections many depend on  during times of crisis and uncertainty.  Similarly, the crisis fed questions about the safety of personal 
sanctuar ies, support communities, and c ompromise d access to basic needs.  The sustained duration of the initial crisis —the 
pandemic —naturally aligned with other crises: natural and man -made disasters, sociopolitical unrest, strained economie s, rising 
human loss , and everyday human struggles . 
During the LOEX 2021 session, participants were asked to consider four sample crises —industrial accidents, natural 
disasters, acts of terrorism and social unrest, and human loss —and identify potential or experienced needs of (a) learners and (b) 
instructors. Themes th at emerged  were the need for safe space s, clear communication , emotional support , and a sense of community.  
Not reflected in participants’ responses were the presenters’ observation of learners’ struggles with self-advoca cy and fulfilling 
physiological needs. Learners struggled  with unsafe living conditions as housemates quarantined, compromising the health of l oved 
ones, financial strain, and food, housing, transportation, and connectivity insecurities. Alongside the pandemic, Texas (the 
presenters’ home state) experienced an active hurricane season , multiple flooding events, complexities of Winter Storm Uri, and 
rising mental health issues  (CDC , 2021 ).  

26       LOEX -2021   -ADAIR AND CRANE - Instructors can assist with connecting learners to resources, but the most immediate support they can provide is strategically 
foster ing community within learning environment s, creat ing opportunit y for authentic learning , and bring ing their own humanity to 
the instructional setting  (Chick , 2013; Imad , 2020 a, 2020b;  Johnson , 2020 ). 
STRATEGIC INFORMATION LITERACY  
An information literate individual must be able to recognize  when information is needed a nd be able to locate, evaluate, 
and effectively use that information  (ALA, 1989) . Information literacy (IL) provides  a basis for lifelong learning . Learners at any 
level can benefit from building a nd practicing those skills and abi lities ( ALA, 1989; LaBrak e, n.d) . Instructors in the academic library 
use the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education  to inform 
and craft their instruction. The ACRL Framework emphasizes t he acquisition, evaluation, and application of information  in the 
academic  context , but it overlooks how th ose knowledge practices and skills transfer to everyday, real -world IL essential in building 
lifelong learners (ACRL, Appendix 1). In their own instruct ion, the presenters address thi s disparity by investigating and 
implementing  related standard systems  including the International Society for Technology Education (ISTE) Standards for Students  
and Educators  and American Association of School Librarians (AA SL) National School Library Standards.  This coupling encourages  
creat ion of engaging authentic learning opportunities to create deeper meaning . 
Learners already struggle to sift through the abundance of information  (Jacoby, 1977; Zimmerman, 2018) . When a crisis 
removes  their sense of security and comfort, added mental strain further limits learners ’ ability to filter and restricts their ability to 
make meaningful connections. Strategic IL instruction can make all the difference . Whether in a one -shot library instruction session 
or credit -bearing course, instructors are able to  tailor their instruction, conversations , and assignments to reflect CT principles  while 
providing strategic opportunit ies for students to  investigate and practice IL in the re al-world to which they can connect to the 
academic world . 
ACTIVE LEARNING  
Active learning techniques provide an opportunity for employing strategic IL instruction. Active learning (AL) is “generally 
defined as any instructional method that [actively] engages [learners]  in the learning process ” (Prince , 2004 ). Engaging learners  in 
the doing and thinking about what they are doing (Brame , 2016) moves learners from passive information consumptio n to sustained 
meaning making.  Strategically combining authentic scenarios into IL instruction using AL strategies strengthens that bond  (Pearce , 
2016) . AL builds and reinforces content knowledge, promotes critical thinking, supports collaboration, provide s frequent feedback, 
and improves learners’ interpersonal skills and self -confidence. When strategically integrating real-life scenarios into instruction 
with AL strategies, learners are engaged and appreciate the purposefulness of the instruction ( Imad , 2020b ; Prince , 2004; Ravitch , 
2020 ).  
The sting of the crisis can be lessened with strategically planned instruction. Folding the principles of CT with AL in IL 
instruction provide s real-life relevance as learners tackle not easily solvable challenges  with sustained investigation in a collaborative 
environment that include s critical thinking, learner choice, and regular feedback , culminating with the creation of a n end  product  
(Pearce , 2016). This combination satisfies lea rners’ basal needs for security and community while providing authentic relevance to 
the instructional material.  
Active Learning in Action  
In the LOEX 2021 session, the presenters provided two examples from their own instructional practices  to demonstrate 
strategic IL during CT utilizing AL strategies. These are outlined below.  
Learners’ need for community , collaboration, and manageable cognitive load  in a hy-flex undergraduate course  compelled 
the instructor in Figure 2 to develop a sustainable means for learners to engage  in course materials. To develop community, protocols 
were established for open conversation and active collaboration . Learners chose research topics , established groups , voted on articles, 
established norms , and loa ded their chosen article into a collaborative digital annotation tool . Each unit thereafter launched with 
instruction, discussion, and low -stakes active practice and feedback in the instruction session. Groups were then tasked with  
collaboratively dissect ing and reverse -engineer ing their article, with each stage  coinciding with a course unit.  Group members' 
activity in the tool demonstrate d their interaction  throughout the process  and provided a means for instructor feedback .

In this second example, the instructor introduc ed the concept of the information search process in a socially distanced , 
hybrid undergraduate course . To connect to learners’ individual prior knowledge  and validate past experiences , learners  visualize d 
and dr ew a research process used previously to complete an academic paper  and its associated emotions . Visualiz ing encourages the 
brain to  transform existing knowledge, an active process, into nonlinguistic representation of that information (McTighe & Silver, 
2020).  To create  community  between remote and in -person learners, d rawings were uploaded to a shared Google Slide de ck where 
they investigate d and ask ed questions of others. This discuss ion encourag ed learners to dual code —express  information  visually  and 
linguistically —and primed the mind for a discussion of the iterativeness  of the information search process  (McTighe & Silver, 2020) .

In both examples, the instructors anticipated learners’ needs, remained connected to current events, and sought to develop 
collaborative communities and authentic learning opportunities appropriate within their instructional scenarios .  
Session participant s reviewed four common AL strategies  (Brame , 2016) to evaluate and defend contextual appropriateness .  
Notable responses included:  
• Silence (being heard) is necessary after trauma.  
• Learners have a utonomy when given space to speak – or not speak.  
• Multiple st rategies b uild community and reduce the stress of participation . 
• Collaborative documents ease cognitive load.  
FRAMING FUTURE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES  
As we emerge from the pandemic , it is important to recognize practices adopted and proven effective will frame future 
instructional practices.  Instructors now have the mental capacity and skill to shift focus from a reactive state of CT to the p roactive 
stance of trauma -informed pedagog y. Instructors should seek to : 
• Remain cognizant  of learners’ po tential traum atic experiences while creat ing space to address  socioemotional needs  (Imad, 
2020 b; Learning for Justice, 2016) ; 
• Construct opportunities and mechanisms for building community and collaboration ensur ing learner s’ voice and  sense of 
agency (Imad , 2020b) ; 
• Capitalize on skills learned or honed, such as self-regulation  or technology integration, to improve instruction, but with the 
grace to accept imperfection ; and   
• Continue to set and communicate mutual high expectations fostering trust through transparency (Imad, 2020b).

DIVERSI FY YOUR  LESSON  PLANS : DE-CENTERING  WHITENESS  
IN LIBRARY  INSTRUCTION  
NIMISHA  BHAT 
INTRODUCTION  
 Academic libraries often work within systems that rely on European and Western ways of thinking, organizing, and 
knowing. Our spaces, collections, and workers are predominantly white despite the increasingly diverse communities we serve. This 
impacts how w e present and teach information to our students and ultimately whose voices we privilege. Teaching librarians should 
create lesson plans that highlight the knowledge and stories of marginalized people in order to encourage students to interro gate the 
notio n of “traditional academic research.” Examining research with students and acknowledging the power that certain voices have 
over others promotes a classroom environment where critical conversations about different types of knowledge can occur, and 
traditio nally underrepresented students are encouraged to think of research from a strengths -based perspective starting from what 
they already know from their own heritage. By centering these diverse ways of knowing in our lesson plans, we show our studen ts 
that w hiteness is not a default for scholarship. When preparing for instruction sessions, there should be a purposeful method to 
illustrate different types of knowledge from diverse communities when teaching students how to research and whose voices they  
privile ge.  
This article will outline how whiteness manifests in the research process and how librarians can incorporate scholarship, 
media, and art by and about Black, Indigenous, and people of color into library instruction sessions in order to de -center whiteness 
as traditional academic knowledge for any class type.   
BACKGROUND : WHAT  TYPES  OF KNOWLEDGE  DO WE PRIVILEGE  IN THE  CLASSROOM ? 
 Librarians often try to codify and analyze what students learn in our classrooms. We are told to teach to the syllabus or 
assignme nt, and create checklists that fail to teach students a nuanced understanding of “authority” or how power and capital 
influence the type of sources that are published and deemed scholarly. These checklists and analytics do not address systemic  
inequities a nd do more to privilege a certain type of success in the classroom while inherently teaching Black, Indigenous,  and 
students of color that their own traditional ways of knowing are less valid. As Ferretti says in her 2020 keynote presentatio n for the 
Trian gle Research Libraries Network annual meeting, “ Few artists and authors of color actually have books dedicated to their work. 
What other ways of knowing outside of books or archives are there? Seeking and using ‘scholarly ’ works means other works are 
sacri ficed or even devalued.” Ferretti says that librarianship depends on systems that work within traditional disciplines origina ting 
from European and Western ideas of what constitutes knowledge. She then goes on to quote Linda Tuhiwai Smith from Decolonizing  
Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples  (2013) , “Most of the ‘traditional’ disciplines are grounded in cultural worldviews 
which are either antagonistic to other belief systems or have no methodology for dealing with other knowledge systems” (p. 129). 
When our profession and what we teach our students is based in traditionally white disciplines, we are in essence teaching st udents 
to devalue other ways of knowing. As Saathoff (2017) says:  
Too often the educational system disregards an d dismisses the reality of students’ lived experiences. As a result students 
learn that their experiences, languages, and histories hold little or no value in the educational setting. The dismissal of 
32       LOEX -2021   -BHAT- students’ backgrounds by the educational system has a d eep effect on communities of color, perpetuating a system that sets 
them up for academic failure. (p. 2)  
 
 One thing librarians can do in instruction sessions to work against this  institutionalized dismissal  is incorporating a 
crowdsourcing activity in the  classroom asking students what they view as knowledge and research, what sources they personally 
turn to ground or inform them in their research practice, which helps to validate and honor different ways of knowing. Answer s from 
students  in my classrooms have included cultural folklore, poetry, oral traditions, and herbalism, to name a few. Cyganik (2017) 
provides an overview of implementing theoretical and methodological approaches to privilege indigenous worldviews in scholars hip. 
Cyganik quotes Meyer (2 003):  
Indigenizing research means supporting theories, sources, and functions of cultural knowledge as the main navigating 
system for the community, alternative to the Western education. Some scholars suggest that indigenous knowledge systems 
have always been focused on providing people with guidance relevant to their ways of living. (p. 148)   
By promoting our students’ own cultural knowledge and worldviews that exist outside of what is considered traditional Western  
scholarly research with supportive less on plans, we can de -center whiteness as the “defaul t” for how our students navigate the 
research process and empower them through a strengths -based teaching philosophy. For students to flourish in our classrooms, we 
need to practice equity pedagogy as conc eived by Banks and Banks (1995) , where instructors adapt their teaching styles and lesson 
plans in order to include students’ exploration and growth toward using multiple perspectives to examine the world . The following 
section will provide a few examples of how I have actively diversifed my own lesson plans.  
PUTTING  IT INTO  PRACTICE  
 Smith College is one of the largest women’s colleges  in the U .S., located in western Massachusetts with 2,400 
undergraduates . In the 2020 -2021 academic year, 36% of the undergraduate student body identif ied as students of color. Library 
instruction is primarily addressed through one -shot classes at the request of professors and taught by corresponding liaison librarians. 
As Vis ual Arts Librarian , I am liaison to the Arts, Film and Media Studies, and Landscape Studies classes at Smith and mainly teach 
library instruction sessions in those disciplines. While the arts hold a unique position in the academy that allows for a wid er breadth 
of scholarly research —artists often require a great deal of information that has no epistemic relationship to art itself —it is a discipline 
in academia that is often predominantly white in faculty staffing and curricular material. As a librarian of c olor, I often find myself 
negotiating between interrogating issues of representation and power structures in visual culture with students and meeting t he 
expectations of my liaison faculty , which often  perpetuate traditional scholarship and therefore uphol d harmful or outdated structures 
of learning. Despite this, I have been able to successfully diversify lesson plans within classrooms that privilege depiction s, 
knowledge, stories, and media of traditionally underrepresented communities.  
An American Studi es Class  
 I was asked to teach a n instruction session in the past that was  for a course  in the American Studies department cross -listed 
with Art History that taught the art and architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It explored the cultura l legacy of the 
Civil War, the arts of the Gilded Age, and the development of early modernism. Students in the class were tasked to do an ext ensive 
research project on the artists or architects covered in the class syllabus, who were predominantly well -known white men. Students 
needed to analyze one major work from this list of artists, one of whom was 19th century American painter Winslow Homer. I opened 
up my class with an image of Homer’s painting “Dressing for the Carnival.”   
-DIVERSIFY YOUR LESSON PLANS : DE-CENTERING WHITENESS IN LIBRARY…- LOEX -2021       33 Figure 1 : Winslow Homer’s Dressing for the Carnival  
 
 
Winslow Homer, 1836 -1910. (1877). Dressing for the Carnival. Retrieved from Artstor.  
 The work depicts a Black community at the end of Reconstruction getting ready for Jonkonnu, a Christmas holiday 
celebration with origins in t he Bahamas that was commonly observed by enslaved Black people in Virginia and North Carolina. I 
asked students to call out what they saw in the painting, regardless of what they may or may not originally know about the wo rk or 
Homer’s oeuvre. Many made ob servations about the use of color and lighting, pointing out the U.S. flags held by the children and 
guessing this had something to do with the concept of independence (the original name for this work was “Sketch —4th of July in 
Virginia”). But not many kne w much about Reconstruction. This was an opportunity to have an expanded conversation on this period 
of American history and the context of the painting. The professor and students all remarked that this was different from a l ot of 
what they were looking a t in class thus far. From there we started to take parts of the painting and research using the library’s art 
reference resources ; we sought answers to questions such as: W hat can we learn about the relationship between Reconstruction and 
emancipated Black  people from this painting? What can we learn about the positionality of Homer as a white observer rendering 
scenes of Black life during the Civil War and Reconstruction? We may assume that this should be a joyous scene based on the 
thematic element, but w hy does it not feel this way? In a class of twenty, I had individual appointments with eleven of the students 
prior to my instruction session. Eight of those students met with me again post -session to change their research topic to focus on a 
work of art t hat depicted Black and/or  Indigenous subjects.      
 I note this particular instruction section as a valuable one and an example of how focusing on a work of art or image that 
highlights Black life and history in a class that otherwise would have handled this subject matter on the periphery (if at al l) is 
important whe n we create our lesson plans. It has an impact on students and widens the breadth of their research skills and abilities 
while actively de -centering whiteness.   
A Landscape Studies Class  
 I regularly work with our Introduction to Landscape Studies class t hat explores the complex and multifaceted relationship 
between human beings and the physical environment. Students learn to critically analyze a wide variety of landscape types fro m the 
scale of a small garden to an entire region, as well as to practice di fferent methods of landscape investigation. Ultimately, the course 
is designed to change the way students see the world. Instead of starting my instruction sessions at the library homepage, I try to find 
a recent article not behind a paywall that covers an  issue concerning a community affected by the built environment. This is often 
how students first consume information, after all —not from aimlessly plugging keywords into a database but from something they 
read online or something they have first -hand expe rience with. One semester I chose to have students look at an article about a plan 
to demolish part of Interstate 81 in Syracuse, New York —a highway that displaced working class Black citizens in order to make it 
easier for white citizens to leave the city  to the suburbs in the name of “urban renewal. ” I asked students to underline terms they 
hadn’t heard of before or didn’t know, circle concepts they knew about, and star themes they thought were important to the 

34       LOEX -2021   -BHAT- conversation. One of the terms that the majo rity of students did not know about was redlining. This gave me an opportunity to find 
reference materials both on the Internet and through the library that defined the concept. We were then able to have a larger 
conversation about the ways in which city p lanning and transportation departments have driven out or segregated communities in 
the United States, and students were able to provide examples of how this had happened in their own hometowns. We then used the 
library’s resources to delve further into sc holarship on these issues.    
 After demonstrating how to do research on redlining using library and Internet resources, I then had students do a mind 
mapping exercise in preparation for their mid -semester papers, where they were tasked to explore a landscape studies issue that 
interested them. I encouraged them to use our in -class discussion as a jumping off poin t to think about how their own personal 
experiences or the environments of their hometowns brought particular issues to mind. The results of this were rich and inter esting —
urban community gardens run by Black, Indigenous, and people of color in Boston; rac ial covenants on houses in Massachusetts; 
bike lanes and the increase of gentrification in Portland, Oregon. Th ese example s show the research opportunities that librarians can 
encourage students to pursue by starting from what they know, or introducing the m to concepts that affect traditionally 
underrepresented people. We can de -center whiteness as default in theory, knowledge, and research practice in the classroom by 
putting the work into whose stories and histories we highlight to teach our students how to navigate the research process.  
CONCLUSION   
 This article outlines just a few ways librarians can diversify lesson plans to de -center whiteness in instruction. Regardless 
of the class or research subject we are assigned to teach, in what ways can we inco rporate examples of database and resource 
exploration that highlight the voices, content, and issues related to traditionally underrepresented or marginalized communities? 
How can we push back against what is traditionally considered “scholarly” sources of  knowledge? Whatever subject we teach in, it 
is our responsibility , as Banks and Banks (1995) describe , to help students understand, investigate, and determine how the implicit 
cultural assumptions, frames of reference, perspectives, and baises within a di scipline influence the ways in which knowledge is 
constructed within it. Paraphrasing Honma (2005), we must bring social context to the information systems we teach to student s and 
promote nontraditional ways of knowing that encompass populations who have historically been silenced, marginalized, and 
overlooked.  
 It takes work to learn about all of the knowledge systems that exist outside  of traditional Western understanding and it 
doesn’t happen all at once nor is it ever a finite process, but it is something librarians need to dedicate their time to cul tivating. When 
our library holdings fail to provide “scholarly” sources to help a student  researching Indigenous casino architectural design, we 
should point them in the direction of tribal preservation officers instead of telling them their research scope is too narrow . When a 
student can’t find any primary resources to support their explorat ion of the busing programs in 1970s Boston and the influence of 
the built environment, we can suggest they turn to oral histories instead of encouraging them to change their thesis. De -centering 
whiteness in our library instruction ultimately means treatin g our Western knowledge systems in LIS as a way of knowing and not 
the way of knowing, and not relying on what our databases bring us as the only scholarship that matters. To close with Honma 
(2005):  
In other  words,  asking  the necessary  questions  of ‘Whose  science? Whose knowledge? ’ (Harding, 1991) is key to 
transforming the ethnocentrism, or the  privilege  of whiteness,  in LIS, and redirecting  it towards  one that locates privilege 
and discrimination, works towards identifying social situatedness (racial, ge nder,  class,  etc.),  and examines  both the 
production and  the reception  of knowledge in the field.  (pg. 17)

EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE AND WHITE SUPREMACY IN 
INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION  
MAGGIE CLARKE  
INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND  
 The concept of epistemic injustice derives from philosopher Mirand a Fricker’s seminal 2007 monograph Epistemic 
Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing  and has gone on to be explored across disciplines as a valuable framework through 
which to analyze how privilege and oppression function in the construction and communication of knowledge. Before delving int o 
epistemic injustice, however, it is perhaps us eful to define epistemology, the concept’s philosophical root. According to The Oxford 
Handbook of Epistemology, epistemology refers broadly to the study of knowledge including what it means to know something, th e 
sources of knowledge, the limitations of k nowledge, the role of humans as knowers, the nature of knowledge itself, and the extent 
of human knowledge, among other topics (Moser, 2002, p. 3). Knowing that epistemology concerns itself with questions around the 
definition, construction, and communicat ion of knowledge, we can infer that epistemic injustice refers to instances in which 
individuals and groups are subject to injustice in their roles as knowers and creators of knowledge.   
In her text, Fricker further defines two separate types of epistemic injustices: testimonial injustice and hermeneutic injustice . 
Testimonial injustice  refers to a phenomenon in which an individual’s testimony of their own lived experiences is dismissed, ignored, 
or contradicted based on prejudicial stereotypes about their identity (Fricker, 2007, p. 7). The example provided by Fricker is a 
woman who complains to a male superior at work about experiencing sexual harassment only to be told that she is not actually being 
harassed and, in fact, has simply  misunderstood her hara ssers attempts at friendliness (Fricker, 2007, p. 8). In this circumstance, the 
victim of harassment is not accepted as a credible knower of her own experience, while her male boss, without any first -hand 
knowledge of the relevant events, is placed in the position of arbiter of knowing what her experiences are. This dynamic is based on 
gendered stereotypes which position women as too sensitive, emotional, and/or irrational to be reliable knowers. Testimonial 
injustice can be found both in interpersonal inte ractions as in the example above, or within structures informed by their creator’s 
prejudicial beliefs.  
Hermeneutical injustice , on the other hand, is a primarily structural phenomenon. In addition to not accepting the testimony 
of individuals, hermeneutical injustice excludes individuals and groups from the process of knowledge creation. This creates a 
cognitive disadvantage in w hich those excluded from the development of shared social understandings are prevented from creating 
the resources that would allow them to conceptualize and communicate  their experiences. Returning to the previous example, “A 
central case of this sort of injustice is found in the case of the woman who suffers sexual harassment prior to the time when we had 
this critical concept, so she cannot properly comprehend her own experience, let alone render it communicatively intelligible  to 
others,” (Fricker,  2007 , p. 6). Unlike testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice is completely structural and exemplifies the way 
in which society’s failure to attempt  to meaningful ly understand the experiences of marginalized groups places th ose groups at a 
disadvantage. N ot only does hermeneutical injustice reinforce existing marginalization, but it increases access to power of those not 
subject to the injustice (Fricker, 2007, p. 152). In this way, existing hierarchies of power and privilege are reinforced by our collecti ve 
knowledge practices.  
Fricker goes on to introduce  credibility excess  and credibility deficit , the notions that individuals and groups experience 
either an excess of undeserved credibility or a dearth of credibility , based on prejudicial stereotypes abou t their identities (Fricker, 
38       LOEX -2021   -CLARKE - 2007, p. 17). To this, I would apply Kimberle Chrenshaw’s (1989) framework of intersectionality to suggest that credibility deficits 
and excesses locate themselves within the context of a complex web of intersectional identitie s, both on the part of the individual 
receiving credibility and those who are perceiving them. For example, while women, generally, and Black men both experience 
credibility deficits, Black women experience both the epistemic injustices of Blackness and wo manhood as well as the unique 
injustices that come from being a Black woman in, as bell hooks called it, a white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchy  (hooks, 2000, 
p 109). Patricia Hill Collins further explores the engagement between intersectionality and i ts attempts to address and rectify 
epistemic injustices in the context of academic work noting that, “Painting identity politics as an inferior form of politics  and 
standpoint epistemology as a limited and potentially biased form of knowing illustrates thi s general practice of discrediting the 
epistemic agency of oppressed subjects” (Hill Collins, 2017, p. 119). 
A reader who has reached this point could certainly be forgiving for wondering —is epistemic injustice  simply another word 
for injustice ? While epis temic injustices are based on oppressive stereotypes which assert themselves throughout our society, the 
heart of Fricker’s work is that epistemic injustice is not merely a byproduct of other forms of oppression, but a unique form  of 
injustice in its own r ight. Epistemic injustice serves the distinctive function of disempowering people as knowers. Central to this 
understanding is the cliche, “knowledge is power,” —that is, having access to the mechanisms of constructing and communicating 
knowledge is empower ing to individuals and groups. Knowledge is also relational —when one group or individual denies the 
knowledge of another, or prevents them from participating in knowledge creation, they are exercising power over them in order  to 
oppress. It is Fricker’s co nclusion, and mine, that this oppressive power imbalance is fundamentally unethical (Fricker, 2007, p. 1). 
As knowledge workers, it is essential that librarians understand that injustices inherent in how we create and communicate kn owledge 
have been, and s till are, ingrained in our professional practice. While, of course, librarians may be subject to epistemic injustice as 
a function of their identities, I argue that, for better or worse, the role of “librarian” inhabits a privileged epistemic po sition in m any 
institutions and, by virtue of this privilege, it is important for the critical librarian to engage with epistemic injustice in their 
instruction. Though epistemic injustices can be found across loci of oppression, this presentation and paper focus spe cifically on the 
intersection of epistemic injustice and white supremacy, how it manifests in traditional academic library practices, and how the 
critical information literacy instructor can begin to address these injustices in their teaching.  
I would like  to acknowledge my own limitations in this arena —I am not a philosopher and the depth and breadth of work 
undertaken by philosophers and critical theorists in this area certainly goes far beyond what I am able to describe in this p aper. 
However, as a librarian interested in critical praxis, I have been personally and professionally concerned with the epistemic for some 
time, likely before I even knew to call it that. If we accept that, by virtue of the deep trust our users place in libraries as sources  of 
credible information, librarians function as arbiters of authority, credibility, and even truth (McGeough & Rudic, 2017; Putn am, 
2018), critically considering how knowledge is constructed, and the ways in which the knowledge systems we work within  privilege 
or oppress is the first responsibility of socially just librarianship.   
LITERATURE REVIEW  
 In his essay “Dismantling Whiteness in Academe” Salvador Videl -Ortiz (2017) describes the often unspoken practices of 
academics which undermine the claims by i nstitutions to value diversity, equity, and inclusion. The themes of white -washing, 
othering, and bypassing of race he describes have been explored by scholars of color in many disciplines ( Monzo & SooHoo, 2014 ; 
Patton, 2004; Reyes & Halcon, 1988; Sayles -Hannon, 2009;). In the introduction to their edited volume, Race and Epistemologies 
of Ignorance,  editors Sullivan and Tuana (2007) describe the epistemological challenges of existing in a world which systematically 
ignores or devalues the experiences and w ays of knowing of non -white people . Similarly, the dominance of white ways of knowing, 
or epistemologies of whiteness, have been explored as an oppressive phenomenon rooted in pervasive white -supremacist and colonist 
attitudes (Dwyer & Jones, 2010; Kubota,  2020 ; Matias & Newlove, 2017; Moreton -Robinson, 2004 ). The structural racism upheld 
by such practices has the effect of gatekeeping BIPOC people from participating in scholarly conversations; even when working  
within structures of whiteness, BIPOC scholar s are not published or cited at the same rate as white colleagues (Delgado, 1984; Ray, 
2018). Given that information literacy instruction undertaken by academic librarians is frequently rooted in the necessity of  
supporting students navigating the often un familiar landscape of scholarly communication, librarian educators who have not engaged 
with issues of racism and other forms of oppression, including epistemic injustice, within structures of scholarly knowledge 
production and dissemination cannot hope to  avoid perpetuating harm both within their classrooms, and by acculturating students to 
racist systems.  
Scholars of critical librarianship have also explored the unique role academic libraries assume  in upholding and reinforcing 
academia and academic libra ries as white spaces. Many have explored how in a society in which whiteness is perceived as the 
default, the value of library “neutrality” is in fact a coded means of reinforcing oppressive white norms, values, and ways o f knowing 
within academic library spaces and praxis ( Brook et al ., 2015 ; Lewis, 2008;). Similarly, white neutrality has been identified as a 
defining feature of librarians’ professional practices and dispositions (Jensen, 2008; Espinal et al ., 2018). Others have focused on 
the historical d evelopment of libraries of all types as sites of acculturation to norms defined by white supremacist culture ( de Jesus, 
2014; Gohr, 2017 ; Warner, 2001). Michele Santamaria’s (2020) recent autoethnographic work explores “The Library'' as a fantasy 
-EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE AND WHITE SUPREMACY IN INFORMATION LITERACY…- LOEX -2021       39 space roo ted in white authority, which librarians both arbitrate and wield . Finally, as Leung and López -McKnight (2020) eloquently 
describe, even in conversations around critical information literacy, critical pedagogy, and in critical library praxis, ther e remains  a 
disturbing dearth of meaningful engagement with race, racism, and white supremacy. While the information literacy classroom i s 
only one space in which the library communicates its values, the continued inability or unwillingness of academic librarians as a 
profession to meaningfully address institutional white supremacy affects all areas of praxis, including information literacy 
instruction.  
EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE & INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION  
Now that we have established that epistemic injustice is a unique type of injustice, one which coincides with both larger 
structures of oppression and the whiteness which dictates library practice, how can we as educators make the information lite racy 
classroom a space of resistance against injustice and what migh t testimonial justice look like in IL? In an era of intensive focus on 
equipping citizens, particularly students, with the intellectual tools necessary to detect fallacy, it is equally important t o reflect on 
what we as information professionals and educat ors are espousing when discussing who or what students can trust. What roles do 
testimony and lived experience have in our classrooms, research, and lives? Instruction which begins and ends with scholarly 
publishing neither adequately prepares students for the epistemic landscape they face, nor addresses the narr ow perspectives 
upholding systems derived from white supremacy, colonialism, and other forms of oppression, which have been, and continue to be, 
privileged in scholarly conversations. As is perhaps evident, epistemic injustice is a deeply complex and nuanc ed topic —a field of 
study in its own right. To attempt to meaningfully introduce epistemic injustice in a typical undergraduate one -shot instruction 
session is unlikely to produce more than confusion for everyone involved. I would instead argue that it is most beneficial for librarians 
to strive to model practices that are epistemically just  in their instructional activities.   
 
While epistemic injustice presents a novel lens through which to explore issues of authority, part of what drew me to the 
notion of  epistemic injustice  is how naturally it works in conversation with existing values in our field. Specifically, I relate epistemic 
injustice to the ACRL framework frame “authority is constructed and contextual,” (ACRL, 2015). If we accept this frame as ha ving 
some validity, epistemic injustice provides a useful lens through which to explore HOW authority is constructed and helps fac ilitate 
critical consideration of how mechanisms of power and oppression function in academic information spaces.   
 
With that in mind, t he following activity is merely one example of a way to introduce testimony as a valid information 
source alongside traditional scholarly communication. The goal of this exercise, and generally of integrating epistemic justi ce 
practices into info rmation literacy instruction, is not to pit different information sources against each other, but to acknowledge the 
varying knowledge domains that each addresses, to explore the processes by which information is created, and to validate testimony 
as infor mation worthy of serious consideration.  
  
Sample  Activity : 
Present students with at least two information sources, one testimonial and one a traditional scholarly article. The two 
sources should address the same topic or incident. For this example I will use a video of the testimony of Sacred Stone Camp founder 
Ladonna Brave Bull Allard on her experience protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline ( Lakota  Peoples Law Project, 2021 ) and the 
introduction to the article  “The Dakota Access Pipeline in Illinois: Participation, power, and institutional design in United States 
critical energy infrastructure governance“ by Johnson, et al . (2021).  
 
How you present these sources will need to reflect the classroom context —if com puters aren’t available  for students , it may 
be easiest to play the testimony video for the class and bring printed copies of the article to hand out. If students are all  using their 
own computers , it may be best just to share links.  
 
Either individually o r in small groups pose the following questions to the students:  
 
Testimonial video  Scholarly 
article  
Whose voice is being heard in this source?    
How do they know what they are talking about?     
40       LOEX -2021   -CLARKE - Would you consider them a credible authority on 
the topic of the Dakota Access Pipeline 
development?    
What might someone learn from this source?    
Which source tells you the most about what it was like defending the land?  
• Which source tells you the most about the regulatory processes which lead to the construction of the Dakota Access 
Pipeline?  
• Would you use either of these sources in a paper or project for school? Why or why not?  
Once students have had several minutes to review the sources, consider, and discuss their answers, come together as a class 
to discuss. In facilitating conversation, guide students towards critical inquiry about their answers by asking them why and how they 
came to their conclusions. The goal is not necessarily consensus, but rather to explore the nuances of contextual authorit y and to 
evaluate  these sources as exemplative  of a range of information types and sources of credibility.  
CONCLUSION  
Though this work focuses on one area in which academic librarians can use their authority to address racial injustice, the 
ability to reco gnize and confront epistemic injustice is by no means a panacea for the embedded white supremacy found throughout 
our society and the institutions it creates. In beginning to explore this framework, I hope to add to existing conversations about 
creating a culture of resistance to oppression in libraries and in our classrooms. Teaching students to think critically is to teach the m 
to question. Further research into epistemic injustice in our knowledge practices will yield more strategies for supporting s tudents in 
interrogating the structures which guide their access to and evaluation of information.

ESCAPING THE IVORY TOWER : BUILDING PUBLIC -ACADEMIC 
LIBRARY CONNECTIONS DURING THE COVID -19 PANDEMIC  
JOANNA NEMETH AND JENNIFER REMPEL  
INTRODUCTION  
 The COVID -19 pandemic has seemingly ushered in a new era of dangerous misinformation, spread rampantly across 
the Internet  and facilitated by social media.  In the interest of  inoculating members of the public against this  misinformation,  and in 
building up their community outreach efforts,  Athabasca University (AU) Librarians partnered with their local public library to 
deliver a series of media -literacy webinars open to the  public and the uni versity community . These media literacy sessions offered 
by AU Library and the Alice B. Donahue Library and Archives were successful  in engaging those who attended and 
have  strengthened the connection between public and academic library staff in the town of Athabasca, Alberta, Canada.   
LITERATUR E REVIEW  
 The value of collaboration within the library context cannot be overstated. Saunders and Corning (2020) point out that the 
“importance of collaboration in the LIS profession is underscored by the extent to which it appears in professional standar ds and 
documents” (p. 454) and  note that collaboration is specifically highlighted in competency standards from  a variety of professional 
associations.  A great deal of literature is available that addresses the need for  academic  libraries to engage in coll aborative projects 
both internally and externally to their home institution.   
Atkinson (2018) provides a thorough review of the literature pertaining specifically to academic libraries and collaboration,  
exploring the myriad stakeholders both internal and external to the academic library that may benefit from such partnerships.  There  is 
considerable material available on the topic of collaboration between academic and public libraries specifically. Case studie s abound, 
highlighting the wide range of activit ies that constitute academic  / public library collaborations. Major topics in the literature include: 
library consortia, in which access to electronic resources is shared (Horton, 2013); joint -use libraries, in which academic and public 
libraries share the  same physical facilities and coordinate programming (Allen, Downes, & Keene, 2018;  Cisse, 2013;   Jordan, 
Lawrence, & Moran, 2018; Sarjeant -Jenkins & Walker, 2015); and community partnerships between academic and  public  libraries, 
in which programming effo rts are shared, but physical facilities and electronic resources are not (Halverson, &  Plotas, 
2006;  Laddusaw & Wilhelm, 2018; Palmer & Peterson, 2007; Richards, 2017; Rust 2018; Saenz, 2020).   
Despite the variety of forms that academic / public library co llaborations take, the motives and values underpinning these 
efforts remain consistent. A common theme in the literature is that academic / public library collaborations allow libraries to preserve 
resources and programming in times of budgetary crisis (Al len, Downes, & Keene, 2018; Saenz, 2020; Saunders & Corning, 2020). 
Sarjeant -Jenkins and Walker (2014) point out that academic / public library partnerships ""are also valuable for raising awareness of 
the libraries and their programs and services, leading to increased membership, increased use, and larger audiences for programs” 
(p. 449). Academic librarians  can leverage relationships with public librarians in  community outreach  efforts; public librarians “are 
often expert at community programming and bring  with them their wealth of day -to-day experiences of connecting users with both 
cultural and library events in the most efficient and cost -productive manner” (Palmer & Peterson, 2007, p. 56). Laddusaw and 
Wilhelm (2018) even argue that such collaborations can result in economic benefits for the community at large, as  the “materials 
44       LOEX -2021   -NEMETH AND REMPEL - offered freely at public libraries assist in increasing a community’s education and knowledge, which in turn promotes economi c 
growth and productivity” (p. 34)   
Library collabora tion as a means of fostering information literacy and lifelong learning was also an important thematic 
thread. Academic / public library collaborations encourage students of higher educational institutions to build connections t o public 
libraries that can provide graduates with access to resources that they will lose post -graduation (Richards, 2017). Palmer and Peterson 
(2007) note  that:  
The promotion of literacy is core to the mission of public and academic libraries.   Outreach programs can be an effectiv e 
way to accomplish this goal. Creative events  and marketing materials targeted to the community the library serves inspire 
library  patrons to visit the library, explore its resources, and appreciate the pleasures of  lifelong learning . (p. 52)    
During the  COVID -19 pandemic, the need for academic and public librarians to collaborate on education campaigns became 
more urgent as misinformation spread online and elsewhere constituted a major risk to populations being served.  The “novelty and 
rapid spread of th e virus have added a new urgency to the availability and distribution of reliable information to help curb its fatal 
potential as long -term remedies remain under development”  (Lor, Wiles, & Britz, 2021, p.1).  Bonnet and Sellers (2019 ); Lor, Wiles, 
and Britz (2021 ); and Lovelace, Thomas, and Harper (2020 ) address these concerns.   
BACKGROUND  
 Athabasca University  (AU),  an online  institution,  is headquartered  in the town of Athabasca,  Alberta, Canada,  home to  a 
population of  3000.  Campus buildings are situated  at the top of a large  hill and are mainly accessed by car commuters  as no public 
transit options to the site are available.  Learners  and residents  rarely visit the physical campus; some science lab components are 
completed  by students  on site,  and AU’s annual convocation ceremony  is usually  held there.  AU Library’s physical space  holds a 
collection of print books as well as workspaces.  While  open  to both learners enrolled in courses and  to the local community,  AU 
Library  rarely  sees in-person  visitors. AU's  Strategic Plan states: “From its home in the town of Athabasca, our University shapes 
and enables mutually supportive communities, regardless of where those communities exist” (Athabasca University, 2018); 
the under -use of  the physical  library  facilities and resources  by community members  is a gap  AU Librarians and staff strive to 
address  in order to  meet this broader goal of community support.  AU Library has  also included outreach to the local  community in 
its own draft strategic plan (unpublishe d and  yet to be finalized)  for, as  Owens and Bishop (2018) illustrate,  another way  “to get buy -
in [for your outreach initiatives]  is to work your initiatives into the library’s strategic plan” (p. 79).    
As the literature suggests,  public  / academic  librar y collaborations  not only  break  down the barriers for the public to use  the 
resources of the academic library,  but also provide  academic library users with  connections to public library offerings.  As Richards 
notes  (2017):  “For the overwhelming majority of  college students, the public library will be their source for quality resources after 
graduation and for a lifetime of learning”  (p. 135). In an article by Dixon (2018),  Daniel  Dotson  recommends that we  “use each other 
to get access to what you need. Acad emic librarians know their campus and have a good feel for whom to contact for various things. 
Public Libraries are in touch with the community” (p. 24).   
AU Librarians  had been planning a program of outreach to  the local  community  which would have  include d book clubs at 
the AU Library,  as well as  information literacy  instruction sessions  offered to the  local high school , public libraries , and community 
groups . These plans were set aside as the  COVID -19 pandemic forced closure of AU’s  physical spaces  in March 2020, and  most of 
the Librarians and  staff moved  to working from home.  As the pandemic  continued  with no end in sight,  AU Librarians  decided not 
to wait.    
Misinformation spread through the Internet and elsewhere is not a new phen omenon.   In particular, “social media platforms 
have become primary vehicles for news delivery; therefore, it is vital to understand how such platforms operate, such as the use of 
algorithms,  to comprehend the user’s ability to critically evaluate the rece ived information”  (LaPierre  & Kitzie, 2019,  p. 429).  The 
COVID -19 pandemic has made this issue more urgent than ever, and  it seemed to AU Librarians a vital  time to reach out to the local 
public library  to deliver  virtual media literacy sessions  to the Ath abasca community  to both learn more about how social media 
platforms work, and to  inform  community members about social media and misinformation.  AU Librarians  reworked a media 
literacy session  for students  that they had used in the past  into a public sess ion in partnership with the town of Athabasca’s  Alice B. 
Donahue Library & Archives. This  facility  is located centrally in  the town  of Athabasca,  and maintains a collection of print 
materials,  DVDs, access  to subscription reference materials, and computers  for in -person visits.  Public programming includes  story 
time for children, but very  little adult programming  was then  on offer.  AU Librarians and the  Program Coordinator  for Alice B. 
Donahue  reasoned that  an adult programming project  represented  a great o pportunity  for both  libraries to expand their community 
outreach efforts.  AU Library runs on a “culture of yes”  (Owens & Bishop, 2018), and outreach plans were supported and encouraged 
by the University Librarian.   
  
-ESCAPING THE IVORY TOWER : BUILDING PUBLIC -ACADEMIC LIBRARY …- LOEX -2021       45 Planning  
 AU Librarians approached  the Program Coordinator  at Alice B. Donahue , to find out if providing public library patrons 
with media literacy sessions targeted at adults would be beneficial . Initially the idea was to  offer  the sessions in person at the public 
library, with available child  programming simultaneously  to allow  parents  time to participate in the media literacy session. These 
in-person sessions were no  longer  possible as the COVID -19 pandemic  persisted . As the pandemic progressed and the spread of 
misinformation became rampant  online, AU decided to rework their first session with topical 2020 examples of how to evaluate 
information found online. The second session, held  six months later,  focused  specifically  on Facebook’s role in spreading 
misinformation, and provided learners w ith tips on  how to evaluate information found there.    
Workshop Structure  
 These sessions were open to  the public and to the university community , and were promoted through both libraries’  web 
pages,  social media,  and email networks. The first session was held on Adobe Connect,  the software that  AU used at that time to 
deliver online presentations.  The second session was held on Zoom, as  this tool  is the software used by Alice B. Donahue 
Library  and, Librarians saw it  as more user -friendly  than Adobe Connect  or Microsoft Teams  (which AU had since switched to  
using) . Presented  by AU Librarians and Alice B. Donahue Library & Archives  Program Coordinators, all hosts were available to 
respond to questions and both libraries were able to publicize the ir programs, resources,  and services  during the sessions.    
AU Librarians  worked to incorporate many  active learning elements into these two online sessions  in order  to best engage 
attendees.  Halpern et al. (2002) describe  how active learning allows learners to  “solve problems and discover the consequences of 
their actions —through reflecting on past and immediate experiences —they construct their own understanding” (p. 1463).  The 
sessions were titled:  1) You Can’t Get a Degree from  Google University:  Critically Evaluating Internet Sources , and  2) Facebook: 
Fact or  Fiction?  The Google University  session  was a two -hour workshop that  set out  seven  criteria  for evaluating  online  sources 
and used topical examples and polling to give attendees the chance to t ry out the evaluation criteria themselves. 
The Facebook  session focused on  evaluating  news  items  seen on Facebook by  teaching attendees how the  Facebook 
algorithm  works,  and how to use  lateral reading  techniques to evaluate information  that they see in the ir timelines.  This session used 
live polling  and user-generated word clouds with  Poll Everywhere  to engage  attendees  with the material.  The Facebook  session 
was forty -five minutes  long because the  librarians were  concerned that the two -hour timeframe of the  Google University  session 
may have hampered  attendance, and  hoped that a shorter session would appeal more to an older audience  and those  with busier 
schedules.     
DISCUSSION  
 The Google University  session had 86 registrations,  with 19 of these registrants attending the session. Even though it had a 
shorter time length, t he Facebook  session had 22 registrations, and only 9 attendees . There may have been a few reasons for this 
drop in both registration and attendance. The  Facebook  session wa s targeted at a smaller community,  mainly senior 
citizens ; Librarians had hoped  to partner with the local senior’s centre  to promote this webinar to their community.  The Program 
Coordinator  at Alice B. Donahue reached out to the senior’s centre to  discuss presentation and promotion  options  but did not receive 
a response.  Unfortunately, the  date of the session  also coincided with a considerable  outbreak of COVID -19 in Athabasca County, 
with one  in fifty community members  becoming infected (CityNews Edmonton,  2020).  This outbreak  may have left community 
members distracted  or otherwise unable to attend.    
The Google University  recording was posted  online on AU Library’s website and YouTube channel  in October 
2020  and has had 7 8 views  as of May 3, 2021 . The  Facebook  session posted in April 2021 has had 31 views  as of May 3, 2021 . 
While the sessions did not have  a huge turnout,  those who attended the session were extremely engaged  with the material, and  there 
was significant  discussion and questions afterwards . The surve y was  only completed by two attendees  from the Facebook session 
and 14 from the Google University  session , but the results were all positive.  For example , all of the attendees who filled out the 
Google University survey felt that they came away from the workshop having learned a new skill. One attendee stated: “ I am a new 
student in my 30's who has never learned these skills before. The internet has changed drastically since I was in school so t his is very 
much app reciated!” The Facebook  session, while having less participation  in the survey, had positive results. One participant felt 
that coming away from the session they had gained the skill to articulate and teach others about Facebook news , stating: “ No change 
to my understanding of Facebook, but 100% improved my ability to explain why my intuition has a concern with something I find .” 
The other participant felt that they now had the ability “ to question sources and how to read and understand sources of information.”  
 
Based on the assumption they were  using controversial examples,  presenters  thought  they might get some  pushback 
from  conspiracy theorists who did not agree with  the material presented;  however,  this did not happen, and presenters  did not hav e 
to monitor and manage controversial discussions.  This left presenters  feeling as though  they were “preaching  to the choir ,” as, based 
on poll results,  most attendees at the outset seemed to have a fairly strong  scepticism towards  online misinformation.  This begs the 
46       LOEX -2021   -NEMETH AND REMPEL - question of how we can engage  with a wider  audience and  pull in  those who  might  not actively choose to attend a media literacy 
workshop.   
 
CONCLUSION  
 The media literacy sessions offered by AU Library and the Alice B. Donahue Library and Archi ves were successful  in 
engaging those who attended and combatting misinformation.  These webinars were valuable as an exercise in  collaboration 
and provided  helpful models  for such outreach efforts going forward. Although these webinars reached a relatively  small 
audience,  there have  been  subsequent  collaboration efforts with Alice B. Donahue Library and Archives, including a One Book 
Project.  Further media literacy and collaboration between the libraries will continue,  as will our attempts to  reach out to a dditional 
community  members and  organizations.  AU Librarians  intend to  continue their local outreach efforts both online  and in -
person  when  it is considered safe  to do so.

GENRE PEDAGOGIES FOR THE LIBRARY CLASSROOM : 
TEACHING SOURCES RHETORICALLY  
COLLEEN DEEL 
INTRODUCTION  
 The research process is often complex and unintuitive. Although library databases, discovery systems, and commercial 
search engines provide students with more information choice than ever before, this glut of information often exists outside of any 
context, resulting in a bewilde ring research process. It comes as no surprise that in a study from Leeder (2016), the genres of materials 
housed within these platforms were misidentified 60% of the time  by first -year students . As library instructors, we have the 
opportunity to assist st udents in navigating these systems and the materials contained within by helping them gain an awareness of 
the social and cultural contexts surrounding the genres of the library. In this paper, a rhetoric -based approach recently explored by 
Burkholder (201 9) will be investigated to help students “learn to identify and respond to the ideological demands of social context” 
(p. 306) during the research process. To do so, we will investigate genre pedagogies —first created by composition instructors to 
grow stud ents’ awareness of the context surrounding the information they use —and demonstrate how they can be applied at the 
library.  
THE BACKGROUND OF RHETORICAL GENRE THEORY  
 The rhetorical analysis of genre began in the late 20th century, with communication scholars exploring genre use during the 
communication process. Miller (1984) was one of the first to synthesize and name this approach in her article “Genre as Socia l 
Action” where she described the importance of genre use in a chieving successful discourse. The rhetorical approach to genre differs 
from how genre is often perceived in library work. In the library, genre signifies the subject or literary classification ass igned to a 
variety of material types as a means of organiza tion. By this definition, genres have significance due to their precise categorization; 
an assigned genre is an indication of the underlying substance and form of a material.  
 Rhetorical genre theory explores genre beyond substance or form. Taking into acc ount social context, this investigation 
asks when, where, and why people use genres to communicate, along with questioning the implications of their use in various 
contexts. A recent definition of the theory offered by Bawarshi and Reiff (2010) described i t as, “ the study of genres as forms of 
situated cognition, social action, and social reproduction” (p. 60). Exploring these factors clarifies how communication inhi bits or 
encourages action in particular communities. Devitt (2004) explained, “ part of what all readers and writers recognize when they 
recognize genres are the roles they are to play, the roles being played by other people, what they can gain from the discours e, and 
what the discourses are about” (p. 12). When an audience recognizes a genre, the  content becomes quickly categorized and responses 
come easily. Different genres incite different action based on the expectations they impart. For instance, a political campaign speech 
or a to -do list provoke distinct actions and responses from their audi ence.  
 An essential part of understanding genre rhetorically is knowing genre does not exist in a vacuum; rather, it inhabits the 
contexts of culture and community. One’s culture “defines what situations and genres are possible or likely” (Devitt, 2004, p . 25), 
by constructing the context and informing the expectations necessary for clear communication. The U.S. political campaign spe ech, 
for example, is recognizable and replicable because of the contemporary representative political culture in which it re sides.  
50       LOEX -2021   -DEEL-  Communities are small cultures, establishing which genres are acceptable for their members to use. It was Swales (1990) 
who examined the use of genre in “discourse communities,” defining them as active groups with clear memberships and common 
goals, often communicating using community -exclusive language. Examples of discourse communities include fandoms and 
academic disciplines. Devitt (2004) explained that in order to gain entrance to or examine a discourse community, one must ac quire 
the communit y’s genre knowledge first. Simply put, genre knowledge can either help or hinder access to, communication with, and 
participation within different communities.  This gated access is the concern for those who view communication through the lens of 
rhetorical  genre. This concern is applied in the classroom by introducing students to the language of their newly chosen discourse 
communities.    
RHETORICAL GENRE THEORY IN THE CLASSROOM  
[F]or the student, genres serve as keys to understanding how to participate in  the actions of a community. (Miller, 1984, p. 
165)  
Genre pedagog ies have become a common  mode of inquiry within composition studies, offer ing an application of theory  
in the classroom . Composition instructors are tasked with teaching students how to nego tiate the properties of academic writing to 
become better writers and thinkers. Genre pedagogies are deployed by composition instructors to teach students how to write t he 
forms of formal genre and to “help students perceive, understand, and even change si tuations” (Devitt, 2014, p. 146) by examining 
the context surrounding genre as it is used. By gaining this genre knowledge, composition instructors believe students become  more 
entrenched in the discourse communities (or academic disciplines) needed to suc ceed in academia.   
 Genre pedagogies were created for composition classrooms, but there are many similarities between teaching composition 
and information literacy, inviting transfer from one to the other. Nearly 30 years ago, Fister (1992) introduced her  fellow instruction 
librarians to composition practices , highlighting the foundational characteristics they share with library instruction. She explained,  
Both fields deal with the teaching of skills rather than content, which makes us stepchildren in the  academy while making 
us innovators in pedagogy. We, more than other fields, attempt to view the academic world from the student’s vantage point 
and try to interpret its peculiar culture in ways that make sense to newcomers. Because of our interdisciplinar y nature we 
teach holistically, attempting to give students a lingua franca  to gain entry into the bewildering variety of academic discourse 
communities. ( Fister, 1992, p. 154) 
Fister recognized that library and composition instructors teach different steps to the same goal: to  assist students ’ negotia tion of the 
unfamiliar rhetorical situations within their chosen academic discipline. Supporting Fister’s recognition, it is not only possible but 
also u seful to explore how genre pedagogies can teach students to navigate the information landscape.  
 In composition studies, genre pedagogies are separated into three pedagogical tactics. Devitt (2014) provided a framework 
for these tactics and named them as : a) teaching particular genres, b) teaching genre awareness, and c) teaching genre critique. Sound 
pedagogical practice, according to Devitt, involves a scaffolded mixture of all three approaches. The following sections will  explore 
each of these techniques  from their original framework and suggest methods of using these tactics to teach library instruction.  
Teaching Particular Genres  
 Teaching particular genres is done by explicitly presenting the conventions of a small number of contextually appropriate 
genres. The rationale behind this method of teaching is to “let everyone play the game, to give everyone access to the rules a nd 
tricks” (Devitt, 2014, p. 147) of the language of the academy. The pedagogical process of teaching particular genres is what Devitt 
called a “teaching -learning cycle” (p. 148) starting when students review a model example of a particular genre and consider its 
social function, organizational structure, and linguistic features. Then, along with their instructor and peers, students c ollaboratively 
negotiate the creation of a new text using its features. Finally, students write an example of the genre on their own.  
 Many genre pedagogists (e.g., Devitt, 2014; Freedman, 1993 ; Wardle, 2009) do not recommend using this method 
exclusively , describing it as problematic for transfer because of its inauthenticity. Freedman, for instance, questioned this method’s 
assumptions, asking how possible it is for students to successfully apply genre knowledge learned in the classroom to real li fe 
situations. Referring to Miller’s (1984) assertion that genre is rhetorically and contextually motivated, Freedman asked, “if gen res 
are a response to context, can they be learned out of context?” (p. 194). The tactics of teaching genre awareness and genre c ritique 
are responses to the drawbacks of teaching particular genres.  
 To teach particular genres of the library, it is first necessary to know what they are. Andersen (2009), who wrote on the 
benefits of using genre theory in the library, identified “infor mation genres” (p. 344) on  two levels: the materials housed within 
information systems (e.g., eBooks, journal articles, newspaper articles, etc.) and the information systems themselves (e.g., library 
databases, digital archives, etc.). Librarians should be  cognizant of both of these levels while teaching.  
-GENRE PEDAGOGIES FOR THE LIBRARY CLASSROOM : TEACHING …- LOEX -2021       51  Teaching particular genres is already common practice in the library classroom —for example, presenting an introduction 
to the parts of a scholarly journal article or a database primer. To truly use this p edagogical method, the genre must be taught 
explicitly, introducing students to the classification and form along with a chance to investigate the genre in context. Ther e may be 
substantial value in teaching the library database as an explicit genre using Devitt’s (2014) teaching -learning cycle. An example 
lesson plan could start by introducing students to a variety of library databases and asking for their features to be investi gated. Then, 
students could reflect upon and discuss a database’s audience, how  the fields in a record correspond to the advanced search options, 
and perhaps Boolean operators, if the situation warrants. Finally, students can use this knowledge to perform their own datab ase 
searches for a class assignment.  
 Introducing students to a genre in this way is often feasible within  the time frame  of a typical one-shot library sessio n, but 
it is important not to be formulaic despite the time limit . Devitt (2014) specified five elements to keep in mind when teaching 
particular genres: a) remin d students that when using the genre outside of the classroom example, the situation will likely be more 
complex, b) give a wide variety of examples, c) encourage use of the genre only when it makes sense, d) leave time for reflec tion, 
and e) name the genr e’s limitations allowing for critique. Abiding by these principles can improve the learning experience for 
students, particularly in a one -shot situation.  
Teaching Genre Awareness  
 Devitt (2014) described teaching genre awareness as the process of clarifyi ng how to contextually understand any genre, 
rather than explicitly knowing a few instructor -chosen genres. This method encompasses genre’s rhetorical nature and “treats genres 
as meaningful social actions, with formal features as the visible traces of sha red perceptions” (Devitt, 2014, p. 152). Students gain 
the tools and the language to analyze, recognize, and name what encompasses the genres of any situation or community.  
 Devitt’s (2014) pedagogical approach to teaching genre awareness uses similar steps described in the previous section, but 
with the goal of teaching strategies for rhetorical and contextual analysis and to identify patterns of genre rather than mod el the 
genres reviewed. An example assignment cited by Devitt asks students to create a genre manual in which they reflect on why, ho w, 
and for whom a genre exists. This process of teaching genre awareness elevates students to active participants in the genres the y use 
and helps them to enter into and understand the academic communities they wish to join.  
 Bringing genre awareness into the library requires instructors to change their approach to how genres are often discussed 
in the library. In his argument for te aching library sources as social acts, Burkholder (2010) problematized the word source itself 
when it is used by librarians referring to library materials. He explored the expansive meaning of a source  and explained, “ the term 
describes an idealized versio n of reality and cannot account for the overwhelming complexity of the information environment; nor 
can it possibly illuminate the rhetorical nature of sources ” (p. 2). Too frequently, the library session is taught towards finding the 
ideal source , objecti fying and dehumanizing scholarship. By ignoring the social context surrounding the materials students are asked 
to discover, the research process remains decontextualized, difficult to navigate, and devoid of meaning. Furthermore, contem porary 
library disc overy systems obfuscate genre to the point that it becomes easy for students, and even librarians, to forget or miss it. An 
indexed material’s format often exists as a single field in a long list of equally weighted options from which to choose when  
conduc ting a search. Sub -genre (e.g., a book review from a journal) is often even more difficult to locate and contextualize in a list 
of results.   
 Focusing on genre awareness in library instruction provides space to ask students to analyze and reflect on an i nformation 
genre using the elements of the rhetorical situation, namely its purpose, subject, audience, author, and context. If students  consider 
these elements of the library database, for instance, they become more rhetorically aware of the genres housed  within the database 
as well.   
Teaching Genre Critique  
 Teaching genre critique welcomes students to examine and question the genres within their social and cultural spheres. A 
critical genre awareness pedagogy “opens students to see genres as created by people to achieve aims ” (Devitt, 2010, p. 348) rather 
than natural objects that are neutral or fixed. By learning to be critical of genre, students question the roles any particular genre asks 
them to play. Devitt described the process of teaching this met hod as an instructional cycle in which students analyze, write, critique, 
and change a genre to fit their needs. Changing and critiquing genre are the additions to instruction, arriving only after st udents gain 
the ability to analyze and use genre. This cy cle emphasizes the importance of scaffolding all three pedagogies . 
 Transferring this pedagogy to the library, additional research should be done to explore the myriad ways genre critique 
intersect s with critical library instruction , but many composition assignment examples described by Devitt (2014) are easily 
transferred  to the library classroom. For example, Devitt suggested an assignment in which students rhetorically review and critique 
a course syllabus. This approach can  also work with any information genre. Additionally, Devitt advocated for “calling students’ 
atten tion to hybrid, blurred, or emerging genres [which] can help students gain a critical stance toward genres more fully normali zed” 
52       LOEX -2021   -DEEL- (p. 155). Realistically, this may present itself in an exploration of the rhetorical differences between a dissertation, conf erence 
proceeding, and book by the same author on the same subject, or a discussion on Sci -Hub, a shadow platform for information 
discovery. Andersen (2009) recognized information genres as meaningful on their own as well as notable in the way they interact  
with one another . Asking students to explore similar content housed within different information genres welcomes a critical lens.  
CONCLUSION  
 Transferring the tenets of rhetorical genre theory to the library classroom can transform students’ understanding s of 
information genres and empower them to become comfortable in their academic discourse community. Practically, Burkholder 
(2010) has also established that using rhetorical and genre -centric pedagogies better equips students to locate and choose the mos t 
persuasive evidence for the situation, therefore becoming better researchers. Helping students achieve this critical eye may be 
challenging for librarians relying on one -shot library instruction models, yet this reality does not negate the value of the a pproach. 
Framing library instruction through rhetorical genre theory constitutes a structural change. Adoption of these genre pedagogi es offers 
a tangible, proven process to integrate genre awareness into existing methods of instruction.

GOGO GADGET GOOGLE SUITE : USING GOOGLE SUITE TOOLS 
TO ENHANCE ONLINE LEARNING  
KRISTINA BUSH, PATRICIA L. HERNANDEZ AND EMILY METCALF  
INTRODUCTION  
 The authors of these proceedings came together as collaborators after meeting during the LOEX 2020 virtual conference. 
With a sudden shift to virtual learning, the three librarians shared ideas and methods for online engagement in library instr uction. 
Desp ite their vastly different institutions, all three created active digital learning tools using components of the Google Suite  of 
resources —namely Docs, Forms, and Sites.  
It is important to frame these proceedings within the context of critical digital ped agogy. So often, library instructors feel 
constrained by a digital tool, however, the pedagogical approach they bring to the tool is much more valuable than the tool i tself. As 
written by Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel (2018) in An Urgency of Teache rs, “None of these tools have what we value 
most about education coded into them in advance. The best digital tools inspire us, often to use them in ways the designer co uldn’t 
anticipate,” (part 1, section 3). This is the core belief that has inspired the presenters’ work and why librarians often function as 
Inspector Gadget types who select the right tool and make it work rather than letting the gadgets confine instruction .  
GOOGLE DOCS 
The Need  
 When the Berkeley campus of the University of California closed in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, instruction 
librarians had to quickly adapt to remote instruction. The biggest challenge of synchronous remote learning was creating acti ve 
learning oppor tunities for students. Google Docs proved useful as a tool to redesign group -work activities and handouts for the 
remote learning context. Implementing Google Docs as “handouts” in synchronous remote instruction sessions provided 
collaborative opportunitie s for students during information literacy workshops.  
A database comparison activity is an example of an information literacy exercise that transitions well to remote instruction 
with the use of a collaborative Google Doc. Inspired by the jigsaw discussio n technique, students work in teams to analyze library 
databases using a Doc handout with guiding questions. After sending a link to the Doc with editing permissions turned on, stu dents 
collaborate in breakout rooms to respond to the questions, annotate th e Doc, and then return to the main Zoom room to share their 
insights about each database with their peers. The collaborative Google Doc serves as a lasting resource for the students to revisit . 
Benefits  
 Some benefits of using a Google Doc are that all the  students actively engage in note taking synchronously; are socially 
motivated to complete the work without an instructor looking over their shoulder because they can watch each other edit in re al time; 
and it offers a collaborative, empowering way to crea te a lasting educational resource. In these ways, using a Google Doc supports 
critical and active pedagogical techniques in the remote instruction classroom.  
54       LOEX -2021  -BUSH, HERNANDEZ  AND METCALF - Collaborative Google Docs can be integrated into various information literacy activities. In an a rt history adaptation, the 
library instructor supplies the title and image of an artwork to research in the instructions and asks reflection questions a bout art 
historical research strategies. Google Docs may be used to encourage collaboration in other act ivities, including source type 
comparison, individual self -paced exploration, database speed dating, generating keywords, searching bibliographies, and formatting 
citations.  
Students and faculty have responded well to information literacy activities that use Google Docs for collaborative work. 
Students, in particular, note that they are more actively engaged when involved in active learning exercises than in a lectur e-based 
workshop. They also reported revisiting the Doc to look at the notes that they took , and faculty have often assigned students to add 
notes on additional databases. The library instructor can assess whether students have met learning objectives based on their  
responses to the guiding questions preserved on the Google Doc .   
Limitations  
 Google Docs can only have 100 active editors at a time, so it would not be possible to use this tool in a very large class. 
The presenters do not suggest using a collaborative Google Doc with a class greater than 40 students, as the number of editor s 
become s overwhelming above 40 . 
GOOGLE FORMS  
The Need  
 In Fall 2019, librarians at UC Berkeley developed a Digital Library Notebook in response to a call for instructional resilien ce 
during a particularly damaging wildfire season. In 2020, with the shift to onlin e learning, the librarians at Texas A&M University -
Corpus Christi utilized the Notebook template to create digital worksheets as a way to engage in library instruction for newl y 
asynchronous virtual classes.  
When it comes to asynchronous online learning, digital learning objects need to contain all of the essential aspects of library 
instruction without a librarian’s presence. Video tutorials can replicate demonstrations, but they rarely allow students to e ngage in 
active learning and thoughtful reflection . Digital worksheets created in Google Forms provide a way to incorporate the active 
engagement students often miss out on when simply watching video tutorials.  
Google Forms enables the creation of multi -page worksheets, which allows for clearly organized  information. Many 
question types are available —including multiple choice, multiple answer, and open text entry —allowing the creator to determine 
the most effective question -type to encourage resource exploration and knowledge demonstration. Google Forms a lso allows the 
integration of multimedia, so embedding short demonstration videos alongside GIFs and images provides ample opportunity to 
demonstrate the steps students must take to accomplish their assignment.  
To deploy a Form, the worksheet creator can s imply send out a link. This link can be distributed via email or social media, 
hosted on a library webpage, or included in a learning management system, like Blackboard, Moodle, or Canvas . 
Benefits  
 In addition to ease of distribution, there are many benef its to teaching an asynchronous lesson through a Google Forms 
digital worksheet.  
Through Forms it is easy to incorporate any requisite demonstrations. Though time consuming in a synchronous learning 
setting, short video tutorials, GIFs, and images can rep licate the necessary demonstrations while letting students find a pace that suits 
their learning style.  
Because there is no time constraint to work within, worksheets can cover a breadth of topics, allowing librarians time to 
expand on the use of resource s and incorporate reflection questions that often go unasked when pressed for time. Reflection is an 
important part of critical thinking, and these worksheets allow the space for students to seriously consider the purpose of t hese 
resources and the implica tions of the information they discover.  
Built as complete learning experiences within themselves, students can respond to the worksheets whenever it is convenient 
for them. Students in an asynchronous course likely chose the course because of its flexible schedule. These worksheets are a n easy 
way for libraries to accommodate student and faculty needs while providing the instruction students need to succeed in their c ourse.  
-GOGO GADGET GOOGLE SUITE : USING GOOGLE SUITE TOOLS…- LOEX -2021       55 Google Forms makes learning assessment simple. With Forms, student responses are collected through a Google Sheets 
spreadsh eet along with a timestamp of their submission. Sheets makes it easy to read through, assess, and distribute the responses to  
the faculty member for grading. Because all of the responses to a Form can be collected into a Google Sheets spreadsheet alon g wit h 
a timestamp, student work is easy to read through, assess, and distribute to a professor for grading . 
Limitations  
 The primary limitation of using Google Forms to create asynchronous virtual worksheets is that Google Forms creates 
objects that are meant to be completed in one sitting. As such, there is no obvious way to save one’s work and return to it. Students 
in asynchronous courses are often accustomed to working when they can and returning to assignments as needed.  
To allow students the flexibility of returning to a worksheet if necessary, there are two potential solutions. First, when 
creating a worksheet, the creator can include instructions on how to submit one’s responses and save the link Google Forms pr ovides 
after submission that reads “Edit y our responses.” Students can use this link as many times as they like to return to their worksheet, 
resubmitting their work each time. This does preclude marking any questions as “required” in the Form, which would prompt a 
student to answer all questions before submission.  
The second workaround for this problem is to have someone unfamiliar with the content go through the form before it is 
distributed and time themselves. The worksheet creator can then mention the average time needed to complete the worksheet in the 
assignment instruction. While this does not help students save and return to their work, it does give them reasonable expecta tions so 
they can set aside the time required to fill out the Form in a single sitting . 
GOOGLE SITES 
The Need  
 Google Sites is a website builder similar to WordPress, Wix, and Weebly. This feature of the Google Suite provides intuitive 
tools to quickly build a website. Layouts, font and color themes, and a variety of embedding options are available to meet th e needs 
of site builders.  
A need for online engagement, both for information literacy instruction and for general library outreach, prompted the use 
of Google Sites as a host for virtual escape rooms. Adapted from the layout for physical escape rooms, the Google S ites virtual 
escape room would begin with a story -building narrative to immerse students. The students would then proceed to the first puzzle 
and so on, applying information literacy and digital literacy skills and techniques to learn and escape in a colla borative virtual setting .  
Benefits  
 Since this is a tool within the Google Suite, it is free to use. Also, as is the nature of Google, it is an excellent collabo rative 
tool. Librarians from the same university or across institutions can collaborate to dev elop an information literacy escape room to 
implement at their respective libraries.  
Numerous studies have presented the benefits of learning through play (Rush, 2014). This hands -on, active approach allows 
the application of theory and abstract concepts t hrough a captivating activity. It also allows librarians to step away from the 
demonstration -heavy model and shift to a more engaging approach. Additionally, when partnered with brief demonstration videos 
viewed prior to a library session, library instruct ors can lead students through a flipped classroom session . 
Limitations  
Due to the nature of virtual escape rooms, there are some aspects to consider when building one. For example:  
• Brevity: Be cognizant of the time it takes to read through the story -buildi ng narrative and instructions. When the escape 
room timer begins, the desire to read through the narrative decreases. The goal is to be as succinct but engaging as possible . 
This may require iteration.  
• Timing: Carefully design the room to provide the right  level of difficulty, ideally with an 80 -90% escape rate. The goal is 
for students to learn while being challenged in an enjoyable way. Allow time for a discussion on the most challenging 
puzzle(s) of the escape room and to review each puzzle in the event that some students did not escape.  
• Difficulty level: Be aware of the difficulty level of the room and how students will be organized to work through the room’s 
puzzles. Will it be a task for individuals? Small teams? Or the entire class? Difficulty levels can be modified through the 
56       LOEX -2021  -BUSH, HERNANDEZ  AND METCALF - number of clues freely provided. For example, an individual may receive 10 clues, but a class of 20 may only receive 5 
clues.  
• Testing: It is important to test the room multiple times. This allows the discovery of flaws or issues  prior to implementing 
the room with the target audience. Testing also provides the opportunity to determine the difficulty level of the room itself . 
As evidenced by the points listed above, the main limitation for using Sites to create an escape room cent ers less on the tool itself 
and more on the high time demand required to build a virtual escape room. It does take time and effort, but ultimately escape  rooms 
can benefit a library’s information literacy program as well as the students who engage with the m. 
CONCLUSION  
Utilizing the tools mentioned in this article takes active and digital learning objectives a step further, allowing students the 
opportunity to build on their familiarity with information and digital literacy techniques and apply them in a di rect and engaging 
manner. These tools can be used to gamify the approach library instructors take when delivering sessions, help implement flip ped 
classroom techniques, and even sometimes eliminate the need for a live library instruction session.  
Google Suite offers free opportunities for collaboration within the library, university, and across the nation. All it takes is 
the courage and curiosity to explore the tools available through Google. Consider finding a new colleague or two and build so mething 
incredible together!

“I WASN’T EXCITED FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT , BUT I AM NOW”: 
INCREASING MORALE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE 
UNDERGRADUATES THROUGH ENGAGING PRACTICES  
NATALIA ESTRADA  
INTRODUCTION  
 The school year of 2020 -2021 has been a year full of unexpected events. In the past year , undergraduate students at UC 
Berkeley have had to face many difficult situations that could affect their ability to do coursework . This past year has included a 
globa l pandemic  and the isolation that came with it,  police violence against black and brown bodies , and a very emotionally draining 
US presidential election  (a factor that can have effects on finding information on candidates (Valentino et al, 2008) ). This is on top 
of the constant stress and difficulties of being a college student.  In a student pulse survey administered by the Division of 
Undergraduate Education, 38% of responding undergraduates reported dealing with symptoms of depression, and 41% reported 
symptoms of anxiety (VCUE, Graduate Division, VCSA, 2020). All of these stressors  can really affect the motivation to complete  
assignments and overall morale.  As the liaison for Political Science,  I noticed that this was especially true with assignments related 
to recent elections. One course, The American Presidency, assigned students to compare the 2020 presidential election with the 2016 
election. Another, California Politics, had students follow t he campaign of a recent state ballot initiative, from when the initiative 
made it onto the ballot, to the election outcome. These assignments result from  library instruction session  that focus es on primary 
resources, government information, and ephemera re lated to these campaigns  
Understanding the mental and emotional issues facing these students,  my lesson plan needed to help spark as much 
enthusiasm as possible for these assignments. I decided to implement teaching pedagogies that focus more on the critic al aspects of 
information literacy , as opposed to solely focusing on showing databases and  resources like in a  traditional one -shot session . 
Following these teaching  methods,  I was able to increase enthusiasm and get students to  become more interested and curious about 
these topics ; they were able to develop interesting  and innovative topics related to these political campaigns . 
THEORY FOR LESSON PLANNING  
 There are various theories  that I rely on heavily  for planning my lessons for the se sessions . One is t he concept of Le arner  
Center Teaching , which  is focused on the way the student learns as a pedagogical approach, as opposed to focusing on the instructor 
(Megwalu, 2014) . It also gives legitimacy to the methods and tools students are already familiar with in terms of information 
searching, instead of banning certain resources based of perceived lack of authority (McDonough, 2015). Learn er Center Teaching 
focus es on the balance of power between instructor and student , and allow students to be able to have some control and some agency 
in the sessions .  
Critical information literacy, in which information literacy instruction focuses on the social power  in information creation 
and access , has been another important pedagogy f or the lesson planning . It focuses not on the student’s ability to navigate a database, 
but to critically assess the resources and information they find (Tewell, 2015). Critical information literacy helps students  also 
understand the agency they have, whet her it’s through the methods addressed in Learner Centered Teaching, or through the ability 
to understand underlying messages in political messaging (Smith, 2013), or through understanding the importance of their live d 
60       LOEX -2021   -ESTRADA - experiences (Giroux, 1988), or even t he role communities have in understanding the production and reading of texts (Elmborg, 
2006).  
In her article about the mental effect on students enrolled in courses on heavy subjects like genocide, Zartner (2019)  
introduced a few methods that have  helped  keep her students engaged without suffering residual trauma. She noted th e importance 
of this consideration:  
Given the potential for burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious traumatization for both students and educators working 
with subjects that tend to be difficult or depressing, it is important to think about how we can frame our subjects and 
structure our classes in such a way that students come away with an understanding of the realities, but also of the 
possibilities.  
Some of these methods she lis ts include humor and enthusiasm . Zartner  noted that humor can be used as  a coping 
mechanism , one that is “essential to maintain our compassion and inspiration” ( p. 360, 2019). Enthusiasm can also give students 
extra motivation to approach a subject (Mahler  et al., 2018. The use of humor and enthusiasm allows students to be  open and free 
while also understanding the human aspects of many of these heavy topics . 
LIMITATIONS  
 Both of these sessions were done in the “one -shot” format:  50-minute  sessions in the beginning of the semester . Each 
session had a  class siz e of more than 50 students . While some of these methods discussed in this paper  were still useful  in convey ing 
useful understanding of information literacy in regard to  campaign electi ons, it did  prevent some very active engagement and active 
learning styles that could have been  implemented . Ideally, library instruction sessions would be taught over multiple sessions, with 
active learning activities that engage the students with the res ources in a group session. My hope is that other library instructors can 
apply these methods, or even apply it through an embedded librarian structure, similar to the methods conducted by Brooke and 
Wiebe (2017).  
LESSON PLAN NING AND ACTION  
 Each session st arted with what we call a “check -in”, in which I asked the students to discuss how they're feeling and their 
mental state before the session . It gives a chance for the students to be open , and for me to  understand how they're feeling at that 
time. It is often one of the few times that they have during a library session to talk about the emotional and mental tol l that they may 
be facing . These check -ins also give a chance for me to learn what tools they are using to learn and a little bit more about what's 
going on around them . What I found from the sessions was that the majority of the students were overwhelmed ; with everything that 
was going on around them it made it difficult for them to be able to concentrate on their school work . 
Using the information from the check -in helped me  determine what literacy skills were more  valuable for these students , 
as well as highlight resources similar to the  tools that they are already  familiar wit h. For example , many of the students knew of 
some  various so urces  for following election campaigns ; if a student says they were following the New York Times , I was able to 
point students to the  Times’  GitHub  repository page to explore more of their publicly available data, especially in relation to voting 
and polli ng. Many of the students pointed  to podcast s that they use d to stay up to date,  so I expanded their knowledge of podcast s 
by pointing to some similar in themes.  Podcasts such as those produced by the site FiveThirtyEight  that go deeper into the value of 
polling,  plus other podcasts that explore different aspects of government and campaign s, such as the one from the LA Times , called  
“Battle of  187 ”, about the campaign for the ballot proposition  187, calling for  cutting off public service s--like schools and hospitals -
-to undocumented immigrants in the 1990s.  
 I also collaborated with the instruct ors for these sessions to think of a way to explain the resources that fits the students 
understanding and made it easier for students to understand what kind of reso urces they needed to find . We end up referring to this 
planning as the “Election Life Cycle.” Searching for c ampaign  information  starts with the basic information of either the candidates 
themselves  or with the text of ballot initiatives . We then moved on to campaign financing , sources of funding and contributions, how 
much the campaigns  were raising , and what that said about the type of campaigns . Students then moved on to the  campaign 
advertising, including  the use of  ephemera from thos e campaigns . Next, students search ed for public opinion polling and the  public  
perceptions of these campaigns . Finally,  the end of the campaign s, with the elections results.  The “Election Life Cycle” gave a clear 
pathway for the students to understand how and where to find the information and be able to explain the general elections that they 
were following, reducing the cognitive load for these already overwhelmed students . 
The sessions move  on to the resources that best fit the  students’  projects . I focus ed on resources that were freely available 
and mostly online  for easier access.  Such examples of resources included the Living Room Candidate from the Museum of Moving 
Image  (http://www.livingroomcandidate.org ), the campaign ephemera archive from UCLA 
-“I WASN’T EXCITED FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT , BUT I AM NOW”: INCREASING …- LOEX -2021       61 (http://digital.library.ucla.edu/campaign/ ), and social media platforms such as Twitter . Focusing on freely available resources 
eliminated the extra concern of having to make sure  the students understood the use of proxies and VPN s, skills that can be taught 
through a short video instead of using the limited session time.  Looking at these a rchives also let the students explore  their own 
understanding of these elections , as well as dig into  the historical context of many of these campaigns . 
Highlighting these resources also allowed the usage of the students’ agency and for them to display their humanity, which  
gives them a different perspective  of these resources . For example , for th e presidential campaign resources such as the Living Room 
Candidate , I was  able to display how the campaigns were summarized  by the museum staff and curators , such as their noting that 
the Walter Mondale campaign of 1984 try to show the theme of the United  States in a dire situation with musical scores in each 
campaign similar to the movie “Halloween .” Students were also introduced to all the different incidents  in election campaign s that 
seem humorous now , but had an impact at the time . such as the inciden t of Gerald Ford  eating the corn husk on a tamale during the 
campaign in Texas . For the ballot initiatives  projects,  using the UCLA campaign archive collection highlight ed recent campaigns 
for ballot initiatives and some of the more useful and humorous ways the se campaigns  were reaching out to communities . For 
example , Proposition 64 , which pushed for the  legalization of marijuana , campaign events and outreach  were named  after cer tain 
stereotypical associations (an example being a Halloween event called “the Dankening”).  I highlight these events and resources, in 
connection with some of the other resources that lean more into humor.  Social media platforms like Twitter are not only useful in 
understanding the public perception of campaigns, as well as the spread of misinformation, but it also allows students to wit ness 
some of the comedic takes o n the election. Twitter comedy, like Kylie Brakeman’s video detailing every Trump Bot, ha ve been 
useful to keep the students engaged with the assignments.   
ASSESSMENT  
 In order to assess the effectiveness of the sessions , our library instructors  normally use a Google form , offered at the end of 
sessions , to understand if there were any barrier s to learning or the students learn ed anything ne w. However , due to the conversion 
to online instruction,  the response rate of these Google forms was lower than anticipated . Instead , in order to assess the effects of 
these sessions , I relied on noting the  number of reference appointments made by the students in the following weeks  and noting 
some of the topics that they had decided to use for their projects . One student decided  to focus on the voting patterns of Yolo County 
in Northern California and why it  has been consistently voted Democratic  since the 1960s . Another student wanted to focus on the 
term “contributions ” in campaign financing,  plus look into the history of contributions to campaigns . The students who attended 
these one -on-one sessions  are also more open about their feelings and why they ended up making an appointment  when they normally 
did not reach out to the library for help . Many of the students felt that my approach in the sessions  (my openness, my enthusiasm, 
my humor)  created a  more welcoming environment and made them more willing to ask questions . 
CONCLUSION  
This paper showed the various factors that were used to improve student morale during a very difficult year , especially in 
regard to assignments that forced students to work with materials that added on to their mental fatigue. I  highlighted the fact that 
campaigns can have a lasting  impact in ways that many would not have expected , especially on those people who are denied the 
ability to vote.  I also highlighted that the personality and the tenor of the librarian can lead to a more open discussion and sessions, 
as some of the students became more comfortable and more willing to  approach their assignments . Finally , I pointed to the various 
materials that are freely avai lable not only to help students find resources for their projects but also to ease the load of having to deal 
with a VPN or proxy or extra tools that might cause a hindrance for their projects . With these methods, subject liaison librarians, 
especially tho se in subjects like Political Science, can apply them for their instruction sessions  and their work with students.

INTRODUCTION  
In an effort to provide more student -centric support via our library website, four librarians at University of Arizona Libraries  
(UAL)  decided to plan and enact some changes to facilitate easier use of library tools, particularly for novice researchers at the 
university. Initially our research revolved around reimagining library guides and moving away from the long lists of resource s 
prevalent among so many guides created by academic libraries. Though that continued to be a focus of our work, we also decided t o 
approach the library home page as a tool that could be used by students to find resources , especially by those  students  who might  
struggle with understanding what sorts of questions to ask via our chat services or in interactions with librarians. With tha t in mind, 
we created a new suite of instructionally oriented Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) pages for students that are designed  to be used 
along with our existing FAQ tools which focus primarily on questions related to facilities, library accounts, and library hou rs. In this 
paper, we will  look at the thought process behind the se changes, how they were planned and executed , and th en offer suggestions 
for librarians looking to make similar additions and changes to their existing websites and research tools.  
LITERATURE REVIEW   
Our initial research looked closely at past literature about subject and research guides as they evolved fro m the early 1960s 
“pathfinders” to the present -day nearly ubiquitous online LibGuides. We were surprised to find that researchers had long emphasized 
the importance of a pedagogical purpose and design for subject guides. The earliest articles and research (Jackson, 1984; Sizer & 
Warner, 1984; Thompson & Stevens, 1985) pointed to the instructional usefulness of research guides, helping students to devel op 
their own search strategies rather than merely pointing to specific information resources. The instructi onal goals for research guides 
included not just search strategies but also how to evaluate information (Galvin, 2005) and how to navigate through the resea rch 
process (Baker, 2014; Lee & Lowe, 2018; Stone  et al. , 2018). We found that most prior research p ointed to the instructional and 
pedagogical uses of research guides.  
We were influenced by the scaffolded approach to user -centered guides proposed by Patricia Knapp and the Montieth 
College Library Experiment project in the early 1960s (as described by He mmig, 2005) and the Library DIY model —developed by 
Meredith Farkas and her colleagues at Portland State University (Farkas 2013) —which is designed as a system of small, discrete 
learning objects that succinctly address specific questions related to the res earch process. While this research helped frame our initial 
efforts to overhaul our university libraries’ guides, subsequent investigation of the literature has reinforced our convictio n to follow 
this path. For example, recent research on using LibGuides to provide instructional support for systematic reviews (Lee et al, 2021) 
analyzed guide content and found that these guides “focused on information and links instead of on the instructional content to 
develop systematic review skills” (p. 73). The researc hers frame their findings as a significant opportunity to transform systematic 
review guides into skill -building, learning tools.  
66       LOEX -2021   -PASCHKE -WOOD, SULT, DUBINSKY AND HENNIG - Further influence on our approach to redesigning the University of Arizona Libraries’ LibGuides came from research on 
the role  of guide design and how it impacts usability and effectiveness in developing learner -centered, pedagogically focused guides. 
Ahmed (2013) focused on the importance of design to the usability and effectiveness of LibGuides. Guide aesthetics (layout, c olor, 
uniformity, text, etc.) enhance the user’s interaction with the guide content. She stressed that “[t]o ignore the design issu e, to cast it 
as a less important element than content, is doing our patrons —and our valuable resources —a great disservice” (p. 10 4). The goal 
of applying practical design principles to research guides is not visual attractiveness alone, rather “the overarching goal i s to use 
aesthetics to engage users and effectively support the pedagogical purpose of a guide” (p. 117).  
Thorngate and Hoden (2017) conducted user -testing prior to migrating from LibGuides v1 to LibGuides v2 in order to 
optimize the design for student usability because “the structural features of an e -learning user interface can impact cognition and 
student learning” (p.  856). Their results dictated their ultimate decisions about number of columns, navigation menu placement, and 
visual integration with the library website. This research confirmed our decision to better integrate the look and feel of th e University 
of Ariz ona LibGuides with the University Libraries’ website design and navigation.  
Combining the principles of service design thinking (user -centered, co -creative, sequencing, evidencing, and holistic) and 
e-learning project planning, instructional designer Elizabeth German (2017) described a strategy to create “useful and usable guides 
for all learners” (p. 166). Instructional designer Yolanda Bergstrom -Lynch (2019) combined the findings from existing guide user 
studies with the pedagogical and lear ner-centered design principles of instructional design to develop a set of best practices for 
LibGuides (p p. 218 -219).  
Barker and Hoffman (2021) developed a student -centered design for the Kennesaw State University Library LibGuides 
through a mixed -method  research design project involving undergraduate students. Their data supported “the case for organizing 
research guide content according to a research process, rather than by types of sources” (p. 88). The researchers also recomm end 
creating blueprint gui des, allowing other librarians to save time and easily reproduce effective guide structure when creating new 
guides.  
Comfortable with the preponderance of research pointing toward learner -centered, pedagogically -focused guides, we went 
to work.    
DESIGN AN D INFRASTRUCTURE  
At the University of Arizona, a small group of fewer than 20 liaisons is tasked with providing subject -specific support to a 
large university community with over 35,000 undergrads. By necessity, librarians often have to turn to online tool s to support their 
pedagogical and instructional needs. In the past, these tools were often of the variety seen at academic libraries across the  United 
States —some version of library guides, both directed at academic subject areas and specific courses, sub ject or research -based 
tutorials and  Guide on the Side interactive tutorial s for web pages and databases. However, analyzing LibGuides usage, chat 
transcripts and our library’s Frequently Asked Questions database painted a stark picture of how infrequently  these tools were being 
used by students. An analysis of UAL LibGuides usage for a five -month period in 2019 showed that many subject guides received 
what amounted to less than one view a day over the period, and the most heavily used LibGuides were either  course - or topic -
specific.  
With much library research reflecting similar concerns about LibGuides usage and efficacy, we decided to reimagine some 
of our online tools to address not only the relative lack of use of subject guides by our students, but als o to provide tools that would 
be useful to students working independently, regardless of their prior knowledge of library resources. Analysis of the librar y’s chat 
service and FAQ questions submitted by users highlighted several main points of concern for undergraduate students. Disregarding 
questions that focused more on account and facilities issues which take up a large portion of any academic library chat and F AQ 
questions, most of the topics revolved around the same basic themes: citation support, peer  review and scholarly articles and how to 
find them, basic search techniques, contacting librarians for support , and other research support. In addition, the variety of ways in 
which students sought support for these issues indicated that it was not clear to many students how to do basic research on the library 
website, and their attempts at finding that information often led to a dead end.  
After conducting our analysis, we decided to take two broad steps to support undergraduate research on the website.  The 
first was creating a foundational page on the website to support undergraduate learners. This would include the library’s exis ting 
FAQ support, which had largely focused on facilities and general questions and contained very little research support. The  revised 
FAQs , which w ere renamed “Help with Library Research ,” were populated with questions that spoke to the needs based on the chat 
and FAQ questions around research such as “How do I develop a good research question?”, “How do I start searching for 
information?” and similar questions. The goal with these questions would be to provide simple, easy to understand answers as we ll 
as a link to other more advanced library resources related to the topic, whether video or tutorial or other medium, as well a s related 
FAQ questions. The goal was to create something of a web of different resources to help students who might not understand exa ctly 
how to define the support they needed. The Spaces and Materials section primarily housed the existing FAQ articles on t he library 
-LEARNING FROM FAILURE : CREATING  BETTER SUBJECT AND COURSE…- LOEX -2021       67 as a physical space and accounts issues. The second step in our overhaul involved reimagin ing how our LibGuides served students. 
We intentionally began moving away from the long lists of resources that many of the subject guides on our website (and other 
academic library websites) currently contain. This reimagining involved grounding the creation of subject  guides  within a 
pedagogically oriented frame and working to walk students through the steps of research in a more functional way. W e approached 
the redesign as if we were planning and implementing an instruction session for students we can not see.  
HOW TO DO THIS AT YOUR LIBRARY  
 The process for this overhaul involved a good deal of planning as well as some trial and error. After revie wing the literature 
and assessing use data and chat transcripts, we began a much needed visual and philosophical overhaul of our guides and FAQs.  
Since we lack internal support for software development and maintenance, we were fortunate in being able to us e some library 
funding to hire a CSS coding expert to help us through the visual overhaul. As this work proceeded, the team began developing  
drafts for our revised FAQs and subject guides. We began with the FAQs, because we hoped to follow a model similar to Portland 
State’s Library DIY project, where we would use thoughtfully designed small pieces of instruction to serve as a foundation to  our 
guides. Our redesigned research FAQs contain a brief answer to a specific question so that students can get assist ance without having 
to click another link: https://ask.library.arizona.edu/faq/306593/ . After each brief answer, we link to more in -depth material so that 
students can take a deeper dive as nee ded. Along with redesigning the FAQs to be more pedagogically focused, we linked access to 
them directly from our library home page: https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/faq . These changes have led to a threefold increase 
in the use of FAQs in the past 12 months. In relation to guides, once we worked through how we wanted to present information in a 
more pedagogically oriented way, we realized that we would need to develop a much better infrastru cture to support guide creators 
in moving beyond long lists of resources. Along with providing training, we developed a creator guide 
https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/guidel ines/new -guide  as well as templates https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/guidelines/
blueprints  that allow guide creators to copy a design and populate a guide with discipline -specific resources and instructional 
materials. In working through these processes, the redesign team found that using a set of guiding questions can help facilit ate the 
process of moving away from traditional pathfinder guides. These questions include think ing about what would come first in a 
research process as well as thinking about how students may engage with different resources and materials as they work their way 
through answering a research question. To that end, we have created a handout ( https://tinyurl.com/convert -your-guide ) to guide 
authors through converting a guide to a more instructional format.    
CONCLUSION  
In the near future, we plan on assessing student use as well as student learning outcomes related to the revised guides. It is 
still a challenge to get students to engage with guides that are more general in nature rather than course -specific , so we intend to 
keep iterating on the guide design to ensure that we are developing a system that uncovers the research process for students , as well 
as guides them to the information that they need. We also plan on creating more instructor -focused guides that allow instructors of 
large general education courses to have our support in pla nning their assignments in a way that makes research more accessible for 
their students. This will eliminate some course -specific guides that contain both resource lists for students and course and 
instructional information for instructors. It will also al low us to have more guides that specifically speak to the needs of users without 
causing confusion.

LIGHTS , CAMERA , RESEARCH : THE INTERDISCIPLINARY 
DESIGN OF DIGITAL STORYTELLING  
KRISTIN E. C. GREEN , JAMES W. HART, PAUL FRISCH AND CARLA R. SEWARD  
 The Pennsylvania State University is a statewide higher education system comprised of twenty -four campuses, which 
includes its most recognized  location, the centrally located University Park campus.  Penn State Scranton , in the northeastern region 
of the s tate, offers thirteen baccalaureate programs, along with four associate degrees, as well as many other avenues to begin one 
of over 440 academic programs available throughout the university. The modest size of the Penn State Scranton campus, with 
approxima tely 1,000 students, creates an atmosphere imbibed with interdepartmental collaboration and robust student engagement.  
Smaller class sizes foster an active instructional environment for undergraduates that organically lends itself to experienti al learning  
projects. It is within this context that the interdisciplinary instructional design for a digital storytelling project began.  
In Fall 2018, a  communication arts professor elicited the help of a history professor, a media commons consultant, and a 
referenc e and instruction librarian to design the capstone project for the CAS 100A Effective Speech  course. Each collaborator 
contributed their expertise to create a digital storytelling assignment that students work on throughout the semester. The as signment 
encompasses both academic and experiential learning while requiring students to accomplish a var iety of tasks such as choosing a 
historical topic, researching primary and secondary sources, developing a script and storyboard, and editing video. While the se tasks 
were created to align with the learning outcomes of the project and overall course object ives, students also indirectly learn that 
interdisciplinary collaboration can lead to gratifying curricular experiences and that scholars in the academic community enj oy 
working together.  
COLLABORATIVE DESIGN  
 The instructional design process for this dig ital storytelling project was initiated when the communication arts professor 
began adapting one section of the CAS 100A Effective Speech course as an honors option. To effectively convert the course int o an 
honors option, an additional assignment needed t o be added to the current curriculum. In the typical curriculum of this course, 
students are required to read a book chosen by the professor, deliver four informative and persuasive speeches, take two test s, and 
participate in a mock job interview.  The co mmunication arts professor wanted to create an experiential learning activity that required 
students to learn specific communication skills through peer collaboration and have deliverables at the end of the semester t hat could 
be showcased at the Penn Stat e Scranton Undergraduate Research Fair and Exhibition, and perhaps beyond. In collaboration with 
the coordinators of the honors program, a project targeting all levels of Bloom’s taxonomy was integrated into the course in which 
student groups would create digital stories about historical events (Bloom, 1956).  Interdisciplinary collaboration with faculty 
members from the Penn State Scranton campus, as well as Penn State Media Commons, become an imperative component for the 
success of the project.  
Before the course was set to run, the history and communication arts professors began the instructional design process by 
determining which decade in American history students would be directed to learn more about.  Once a decade was chosen and 
agreed upon, the histo ry professor compiled a list of major political, social, economic, cultural, and entertainment topics pertaining 
to that decade. The list of potential topics was given to the communication arts professor to share with the class, so studen t teams 
could choo se topics that resonated with them. The communication arts professor would then convey back to the history professor 
which topics were chosen allowing for preparation of quick lectures on each.  The history professor would deliver these short  lectures 
during the usual class session. These lectures gave students a general understanding of the topic as situated within the historic al time 
70       LOEX -2021   -GREEN , HART, FRISCH AND SEWARD - period they were learning about and providing this context was key for students to decide the direction their research woul d take.  
The history professor emphasized the need for students to think about focusing their research to a specific aspect of their c hosen 
topic. The topics were intentionally broad in scope to allow students the space to determine what was of interest or  value for their 
learning. The final version of their video project was intended to have a clear focus and present a unique perspective of the story 
students chose to tell.  
After the student teams were  introduced to their topics and invited to consider th e scope of their storytelling, guidance on 
searching for and identifying relevant sources was offered. The research process for this assignment is critical as the sources students 
discover and read form the foundation for their scripts and storyboards.  Th e reference and instruction librarian backwards designed 
an instructional session around several key student learning outcomes. Students would first learn how to derive a specific fo cus to 
their research by narrowing down their general topic using referenc e sources.  Additionally, students would learn how to locate and 
identify relevant pieces of scholarly literature from searching different databases.  The tragedy of the Space Shuttle Challe nger was 
used as a sample topic. A reference article was shown tha t described and quoted the presidential eulogy which became the focused 
topic, an example of tightening the research scope. Conducting primary source research is a key learning outcome and students  were  
invited to discover voices of the historical period f irsthand. Thus, how to locate the transcript of the eulogy itself was important to 
demonstrate. Following the search demonstrations, discussion was facilitated by the librarian on the difference between prima ry and 
secondary sources and the importance of b oth to establish a comprehensive understanding of any historical research topic.  
A partial jigsaw learning activity was planned for students to apply what had been demonstrated in the first part of the 
instructional session by the reference and instruction  librarian. They were asked to crowdsource a reference list of sources that would 
be useful to create a digital story of any aspect of the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925. For this academic exercise, students wo rked 
within their video project teams and each gr oup was given a specific type of source to find and database to search within.  The 
student groups were asked to share their search experience with the entire class and described the sources they selected for the 
collaborative reference list. Following the  instructional session, students would be encouraged to contact the reference and instruction 
librarian for additional guidance as needed.  
DIGITAL STORYTELLERS  
 To put the technological aspects of the storytelling project into motion, the communication art s professor contacted Penn 
State Media Commons.  Media Commons is a university -wide resource that provides the equipment, resources, and instructional 
support required by students to complete multimedia assignments. Before a specific technology is identifi ed for a project, a media 
commons specialist conducts a consultation with the faculty member. During this time, project objectives are discussed, and a  project 
plan is created.  This plan will parallel and reinforce the student learning outcomes, including  critical thought, and determine various 
scaffolded deliverables of the multimedia project. These deliverables correspond with Media Commons trainings in which a 
consultant discusses the multimedia production process, best practices for telling a thoughtfu l story in a scholarly manner, and the 
software needed to create the project.  Additionally, at the end of the semester, a critique is offered by the media commons consultant.  
These critiques provide feedback on the rough draft of the project and incorpor ate guidance on how students can improve their digital 
story before handing in the final iteration.  
Before the student teams could begin their storyboarding in earnest, they needed to make important decisions related to 
video design.  Primarily, the type o f production students would like to create to tell their story needs to be determined.  The students 
had to decide whether they prefer their video to be educational, promotional, documentary, or entertainment.  Scripts and sto ryboards 
are integral parts of  the students’ videos. Scripting helps organize the thoughts and ideas that will be delivered in the production 
(Penn State Media Commons, 2021a). Storyboarding can assist in the planning of angles, sizes, and order of camera shots and 
movement to elicit v arious emotions from the audience (Penn State Media Commons, 2021b). For this project, the software that was 
originally chosen was the iMovie app for the iPad. The Mobile Media Program, facilitated by Penn State Media Commons, lends 
iPad minis to classes f or multimedia projects. The program allows all students throughout the university an equity of access to the 
newest technology, both hardware and software, for completing their multimedia assignments.  During the pandemic, the softwar e 
shifted from the iMo vie app to Adobe Rush and personal phones were utilized for recording video. Adobe Rush is a program that is 
more widely available to students, cross platform, and compatible with both mobile and desktop machines. This programmatic sh ift 
proved successful and may become the preferred method of video production for this project in the future.  
MOVING FORWARD  
 Educational projects can always be improved, adapted, and changed to better the students’ experiential learning.  The 
historical decade students are lea rning about and the research topics within those time periods are easily transformable.  Each time 
this digital storytelling project was assigned by the communication arts professor, who also integrated variations of this pr oject into 
other courses such as  CAS 250 Small Group Communication, the historical era has differed.  To date, most of the twentieth century 
has been researched by students. Since the key student learning outcomes of this project are primarily focused on the digital  
-LIGHTS , CAMERA , RESEARCH : THE INTERDISCIPLINARY DESIGN OF DIGITAL…- LOEX -2021       71 storytelling process,  American history topics will continue to be chosen to provide students with the opportunity to delve deeper and 
learn something novel about familiar people or events.   
Time constraints of class sessions has led both the history professor and the referenc e and instruction librarian to move 
through their lectures or learning activities quicker than anticipated at times. Implementing more ways in which the students  can 
reach out and continue to consult with these faculty members regarding their video project s has been noted as an area for improving 
their overall productions.  Also, flipping the classroom by giving students assignments on finding resources for their projec ts prior 
to their class time with the librarian has been discussed. This method would ena ble students to establish a foundation of basic 
searching prior to class that can then be scaffolded, with active learning prioritized during class time.  In later iteration s of assigning 
this project, the librarian created a course guide devoted to the primary and secondary source databases  that students are introduced 
to during the information literacy instruction session, as well as other helpful resources.  
This digital storytelling project is highly adaptable to other courses, as evidenced through its l ater integration into CAS 250 
Small Group Communication . Based upon the student learning outcomes of a particular course, a different combination of 
interdisciplinary collaborators could be assembled.  Essentially, having colleagues from different academic  areas eager to participate 
in the initiative is the most crucial requirement for successfully assigning this digital storytelling project to undergradua te students.  
The experiential learning achieved from this project imbues students with a genuine sense  of accomplishment. Students, 
throughout the entirety of the semester, are given command of their own learning paths with the faculty members providing 
guideposts along the way.  Several of these digital projects have been showcased to the academic and loc al community by the student 
creators in the campus’ annual Undergraduate Research Fair and Exhibition. Even in these current times of transition to and 
expansion of hybrid or remote learning, this capstone project has remained as a mainstay of experiential  learning and interdisciplinary 
scholarship at Penn State Scranton and will continue to be into the future.

MENTORING GRADUATE STUDENTS : TEACHING THEM HOW 
TO FISH FOR REAL  
SERGIO CHAPARRO  AND  JOHN CYRUS
LITERATURE REVIEW  
 Graduate students represent an important part of academic libraries ’ users and potential users. The National Center of 
Education Statistics (NCES) reported 833,707 masters and 187,568 doctoral students for 2018 -2019 in the USA. There has also been 
a steady increase in the number of graduate students enrolled in certificates at the graduate level. Th e research  for this paper  examined 
the available literature on graduate students (GS) and information literacy (IL). I t seems clear that research is growing but not at the 
expected rate (Fleming -May & Yuro, 2009). There is some consensus in the literature , however, about several factors that pertain to 
the information literacy and seeking behavior of graduate students. A few assumptions about graduate students' information literacy 
must be debunked and they are highly relevant for this paper. There is a tendency to believe that GS know how to search for 
information and use library resources efficiently , which does not seem  to be the case for the majority of them (Chu & Law, 2007 ; 
Gibbs et al ., 2012 ; Mahmod, 2016 ; Monroe -Gulick & Petr, 2012). Mahmod (2016) and Al -Muomen (2012) also identified a great 
deal of overconfidence regarding searching skills on the part of graduate s tudents. Kayongo and Helm (2010) and Gibbs (2012) 
suggested that even though graduate students may consider  library services as extremely important, they —for the most part —had 
very limited contact with liaison librarians or were simply unaware of their ro le and existence. Even more, reluctanc e by the graduate 
student to contact the librarian seems to occur  because of concerns over appearing inadequate, anxiety, or feeling that it is not the 
job of the librarian to do their job (Fleming -May & Yuro, 2009 ; Sadler & Given, 2007). Catalano  (2013) and Chu and Law (2007)  
shared a lot of similar conclusions in their literature reviews: library instruction that addresses graduate students is absolutely 
necessary because GS may not carry the information literacy an d searching skills we assume they do. Disciplinary differences may 
occur and we may also need to plan specific information literacy  instruction and curriculum  for masters and doctoral or Ph.D. 
students separately.  In addition, graduate students tend to co nsult their professors first regarding their information needs, even 
though Fleming -May and Yuro (2009) suggested that faculty's information literacy guidance and skills may be very limited, thus 
complicating the information literacy problem. Sloan and McP hee (2013) found that fellow students are also important sources of 
information literacy advice but warned about those graduate students who may feel isolated at bigger programs and unable to c onnect 
with peers (p.8). This leaves the graduate students copi ng with various strategies for information literacy needs and increasing their 
levels of stress and anxiety which in turn affect their information searching success (Kuhlthau, 1998 ; Mellon, 1986). Relevant for 
this research and the role of the liaison as a mentor is the fact that Sadler and Given (2007) demonstrated that that ""person al contact 
with librarians is an effective communication tool, possibly the most effective tool the aca demic library has at its disposal"" (p.135).   
It was i mportant for this research to identify some assumptions about graduate students' information literacy skills, their 
perceptions of self -efficacy, the faculty competence at online searching, and the grad uate students' awareness of the role of the liaison 
or librarian. Perhaps it is time to understand that academic libraries need to build spaces and infrastructures for “graduate  students 
literacies” that provide a more holistic approach to their informatio n needs , where the liaison could be even more effective 
(McDaniel, 2018). A graduate study room is not enough. Information literacy programs and peer to peer counseling, interventio n 
and dialogue spaces seem to be much needed. In addition, it is time perha ps to bring these issues into effective library education in 
order to maximize the outreach impact of future academic librarians. Clarifying misconceptions about graduate students' infor mation 
searching skills and the support of their ecosystems would better target the resource -intensive academic library services.  
74       LOEX -2021    -CHAPARRO  AND  CYRUS - A major function of graduate school at the masters and doctoral levels is the formation of professional identity. Despite the  
significance of the phase of academic development, graduate students often struggle to simultaneously build the knowledge and 
skills required in their future profession and construct this professional identity. Additionally, these identities and the norms  of the 
profession may be based on idealized versions of researchers a nd faculty in the field with little basis in reality (Hall & Burns, 2009). 
Research on the formation of these professional identities describes a development network  cultivated by graduate students to 
advance their work and career. However, the network als o shapes their professional identity (Baker & Lattuca, 2010). While the 
majority of the developmental networks of graduate students are comprised of peers and faculty, other members come from outsi de 
of these traditional areas. Extending out to family and friends, these external members of the network influence the development of 
professional identity in ways similar to those of the core academic relationships (Sweitzer, 2009). While there is little res earch to 
demonstrate such as role, studies in the libra ry and information science literature do point to a potential for librarians to act in a 
mentorship capacity with graduate students (Baruzzi & Calcagno, 2015 ; Caravello, 2007). While research is needed to describe the 
extent to which librarians function wi thin the developmental networks of graduate students and serve in a mentoring or coaching 
capacity, there is little doubt that interactions between librarians and graduate students are complex and multifaceted. Addi tionally, 
when it comes to these interact ions, it may also be helpful to briefly examine definitions and roles associated with mentoring. Kram 
(1983) delineated both phases and roles associated with mentorship , such as  the idea that mentorship is composed of two functions: 
those that serve to enh ance careers and those that serve a psychosocial function. Roles that served the goal of career enhancement 
included granting exposure and visibility to mentees, providing coaching, and identifying challenging opportunities. Psychoso cial 
functions addresse d by mentoring included role modeling behavior, providing counseling, and in some cases friendship (Kram, 
1983). While these specific functions of mentorship are useful in envisioning or contextualizing the benefits of these relati onships 
to graduate stude nts, recent research has sought to distinguish between types of assistance offered by the various members of a 
particular developmental network. Specifically, Marcdante and Simpson (2018) distinguish between advising, coaching, coaching 
with wisdom, and me ntoring. Most important for our discussion is the difference between coaching  (a time -limited relationship 
whose goal is to assist the learner in accomplishing or acquiring a task or skill ) and mentoring  (a long -term relationship focused on 
career developm ent and socialization within a field ). The in between form of guidance, coaching with wisdom, is a distinct mixture 
of coaching and mentoring where the relationship is time -limited and focused on a task or skill that is contextualized by the field of 
study  (Marcdante & Simpson, 2018). In many ways, the concept of a task - or skill -focused relationship placed within the student’s 
field of study mirrors the traditional mode of consultations with a subject -specific librarian.  
THE AFFECTIVE CONTEXT OF GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH  
 The role of affective and emotional factors in their information seeking behavior and  the existence of library anxiety among  
graduate students is verified by the literature , as it is the variety of  strategies they use to cope with inform ation challenges, such as 
information overload, time, difficulties building effective searches, and time constraints that limit their ability to perfor m research 
(Catalano, 2012). Graduate students live under a continuous state of stress. They have deadlin es, advisors, an important group of 
them work part -time or full time or have TA duties, and in some cases are the first line of library information literacy in the classroom. 
By this, we mean they build , convey and disseminate information literacy tools an d dexterities back to their classrooms and faculty 
advisors.  
We observed a great deal of them approaching us and being vocal about their stresses. These affective and emotional factors 
remind us to take a more holistic approach towards mentorship —for exam ple, offering spaces for dialogue about their concerns 
regarding online searching, and their self -perceptions and efficacy. Therefore, graduate students do face important information 
literacy challenges. This situation becomes more complex as we understand  that they are part of an actual research ecosystem 
composed of different actors, contexts, and constructs (Urquhart & Rowley, 2007). Graduate students do not exist in a vacuum,  
especially th ose at the  Doctoral level who are embedded at research oriented i nstitutions under complex ecosystems.  
TEACHING GRADUATE STUDENTS HOW TO FISH FOR REAL 
 Teaching GS how ""to fish for real"" should involve also paying close attention to the affective factors that affect their 
perceptions of the library information tools. I n the course of our experience as liaisons we have identified several instances of 
""imposter syndrome"", low self -efficacy, and reluctance  to ask others  (e.g.,  the advisor or the teacher ). In addition, teaching them 
how to fish for real requires to move bey ond the traditional consultation, but instead walking with the GS through the research 
process, speaking interdisciplinarity , which shapes most research nowadays (O'Connor & Newby, 2011) , promoting constant 
communication and lifelong learning.  
Mentoring graduate students and teaching them to fish for real are two connected strategies that we believe are conducive 
to student success and impactful library outreach. To educate graduate stude nts on how to fish for real should involve, among other 
things, to teach for lifelong learning. As academic librarians and liaisons at VCU Libraries, we faced a very important amoun t of 
graduate student interactions in the behavioral, social, and health sciences. A good portion of those engaging interactions and 
consultations have prompted our interest in educating for lifelong learning, especially in the context of a research universi ty. Those 
-MENTORING GRADUATE STUDENTS : TEACHING THEM HOW TO FISH…- LOEX -2021        75 interactions have also shaped our skills and teaching styles dr amatically, making us more aware about teaching for the (graduate 
students ’) future. Our information literacy instruction, teaching, and mentorship, may have a lasting and positive effect in their 
academic and professional futures. We believe that it is al so our task to mentor or  to advise those graduate students for the future 
so they can fish for themselves when the situation arises, and educate others about how to fish. If we want to educate for lifelong 
learning , we need to connect what we do in the cl assroom context to what future research the student might be interested in. Databases 
transform and evolve, research tools and paradigms like Systematic Literature Reviews may change, searching options get refin ed 
or simply disappear, research themes withi n disciplines may shift and data may replace text, the field's culture may abruptly get 
transformed —these are some aspects that need to be carefully explained and instructed for lifelong learning.  
Librarians and liaisons interested in teaching graduate stu dents how to fish for real  would make effective and efficient use 
of mentorship as a form of establishing a more consistent contact and connection system between the library and the graduate student. 
In addition, teaching them to fish for real  requires the  librarian to mentor by addressing the user in a holistic way. This involve s 
paying attention to their learning styles, emotional maturity regarding the research task, and verifying through consultations and 
interactions their self -described information li teracy skills. It also require s a constant dialogue that enhances the quality  of the 
interaction. This in turn would solve the inherent initial anxiety of contacting the liaison/librarian and facing the interac tion which 
usually triangulates between librar ian, student/researcher, and faculty member. Mentorship does not come without challenges: we 
believe that knowing when to intervene is one of them. The timing is critical for the future course of the interaction since becoming 
intrusive can also affect the  relationship between the graduate student and the advisor. This is where our expertise and intuition 
educating graduate students would come very handy and useful . It informs and sets up efficient boundaries for our zones of 
intervention.  
SUGGESTED MENTOR ING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES  
 Mentoring should offer  graduate students tools for self -learning at their own pace.  We suggest paying attention to tutorials 
for educating on the query. The usefulness of this approach is made more evident by the online learning environments pushed by the 
COVID -19 pandemic. We found that a great deal of students were asking for materials that could  ""teach them on their own"" and 
facilitate their exposure to complex query building or examination of database details. We believe our experiences regarding this 
tendency to self -education in information literacy could be transferable. Current software makes it possible to create more self -paced 
online learning tools that could facilitate the librarian's graduate student mentorship. Those  tools, targeted specifically to user needs 
should address some of the literature's assumptions about graduate students' searching and researching skills, pay attention to the 
affective factors of the search for information, and among other things, connect  and reconnect the graduate student to the library. 
Connecting more closely to the faculty, advisors, and researchers close to the graduate students is a must ( Cowan & Eva, 2016; 
Moore &  Singley, 2019). Spending time with the librarian is another necessary  factor for the mentorship , necessary to teach them 
how to fish for real, since the librarian's personal touch is the most important communication tool for the library (Harkins et al., 
2011 ; Sadler  & Given, 2007).  
THE LIAISON 'S BOUNDARIES AND LIMITATIONS  
Boundaries for our mentorship are connected fundamentally to our own subject expertise, the number of “flight hours” we 
have interacting with graduate students which in turn inform our intuition and teaching and mentorship styles. Second, our o wn time 
and schedules represent a major limiter,  as academic librarians do a lot of other things aside from teaching and outreach.  Third, we 
are constantly aware of being unobtrusive, we don’t want to risk dialogue and we are fully aware and respectful of the the faculty 
zones of intervention.  Finally, and perhaps one of the biggest lessons of the COVID -19 pandemic has been our recognition of the 
different educational and mentorship opportunities that the online vs . face-to-face context offer to our outreac h. Our comfort zones 
for mentorship could be affected by these contexts ; graduate students may also prefer mentorship only in certain contexts.  
THE EXPECTATIONS AND REALITY OF GRADUATE STUDENT – LIBRARIAN INTERACTIONS  
Understanding the possibilities of li brarians as mentors and coaches for graduate students must begin with a discussion of 
the container where most of the interactions between librarians and graduate students occur, the research consultation. Gradu ate 
students approach the librarian in variou s stages of learning, experience, and preparation , as well as with varying assessments of 
their own skills in library research. Additionally, there are a significant number of intrinsic traits and extrinsic factors that students 
bring with them into the in teraction with the librarian. Many of these are represented both in Kuhlthau’s (1998) affective aspects and 
Urquhart and Rowley’s (2007) ecosystem but most are not evident to the librarian upon first contact. Additionally, and specifically 
relating to the student’s skills, comfort, and preparation, Heinström (2006) proposes patterns that students exhibit in how they search 
for information, ranging from exploratory to specific and from surface level nonstrategic exploration to deep and strategic s earching. 
The initial, and sometimes most difficult, job of the librarian is to understand where the student is in all of these aspects in order to 
provide the most efficient and effective help possible.  
76       LOEX -2021    -CHAPARRO  AND  CYRUS - Aside from the student -related factors brought to an interactio n, there are points of divergence  that shape and alter the nature 
of the interaction between librarian and graduate student. These points push the consultation and the relationship in one dir ection or 
another and force the librarian to react and consider t he form that assistance will take. Common points of divergence include the 
clarity and focus of the initial question presented by the student, whether the impetus for the consultation lies with the st udent or a 
faculty member, the amount of work put in pri or to the interaction, the personality of the student, and constraints placed on the 
interaction such as time or student/faculty perception of library value. A point of divergence may be as simple as a student wanting 
to take ownership or leadership in a p roject where they have interest but little or no experience. This creates an entirely different 
dynamic from a situation in which a student is happy to cede control of the interaction to the librarian. It forces a definit e coaching 
mindset onto the librari an, who may be responsible for working with the student as they learn and check their skills. Another point 
of divergence that drastically alters the relationship within the interaction is when leadership is ceded completely to the l ibrarian. 
For instance,  when a team of novices decides to pursue a complex project based on using and analyzing research literature, such as 
a systematic review, the librarian may assume the role of both expert and coach. This divergence extends the responsibility o f the 
librari an beyond the role of expert searcher to coach on methodology and process, a role in which many may not be comfortable. 
Underpinning all of this, in the health sciences especially, is a culture of rapid accumulation of knowledge and acquisition of skills.  
LESSONS FROM THE HEALTH SCIENCES  
The health sciences as a learning environment has a number of distinct features, including but not limited to persistent 
exposure to research and the clinical setting. Functioning in a research -intensive environment means that students in the health 
sciences typically have more regular exposure to research as a process while the clinical setting entails constant adaptation  to new 
knowledge and skills. There are a variety of models that have been used to train students in th is setting over the years. The See One, 
Do One, Teach One paradigm is based on a pattern of demonstration, practice, and confirmation of mastery. The See One stage i s 
characterized by expert walkthrough of a process or procedure wherein skills are broken d own into simple component pieces. The 
Do One stage involves verbal and manual walkthrough by the learner demonstrating basic understanding. Finally, the Teach One 
stage is used to confirm mastery by having the learner assume the role of expert and pass the ir knowledge on to other students 
(Birnbaumer, 2011; Speirs, 2018). Another common framework for developing students in this setting are the dual concepts of self -
directed and self -regulated learning. Both are learner -controlled approaches to learning new information and skills (Gandomkar, 
2018). Self -directed learning, however, is focused on the broader process of sustained learning o ver the course of a career (Loyens, 
2008) , whereas self -regulated learning is described as a process of planning, learning, assessment, and adjustment focused on a 
specific task (White, 2014). A final, more recent framework used to guide student development is that of the master adaptive learner. 
This conceptual framework is an extension of self -regulated learning that aims to assist learners in functioning in an environment 
where professionals must balance innovation and efficiency in problem solving, knowledge, and skill acquisition (Cutrer, 2017 ). 
These concepts and models manifest in different ways, but they may go some way to explain why graduate students treat 
searching as a skill that is either relevant to their future career or not. While not all of the students in the health scien ces follow this 
model, there is a tendency for interactions to take one of three paths: stud ents see a useful skill to acquire and make plans (with the 
librarian) to learn and practice the skill, an in  between path whereon the student observes the expert (librarian) perform the skill and 
begins to understand the complexity but does not seek maste ry, or students (or faculty) recognize expertise that takes more time and 
energy to acquire than they can commit and turn to a transaction mindset instead of skill acquisition. Moving forward and dra wing 
on the lessons from the models discussed above, libr arians would benefit from developing models for working with graduate students 
on skills acquisition through resources, training, coaching, and assessment. In part, this means developing a better understa nding of 
which support tools facilitate learning but  also offering the appropriate level of assistance to help the student succeed and achieve 
independence / autonomy in use of skills.  
TAKEAWAYS  
The most common role of the liaison librarian is that of a bridge, facilitating the interaction between student and faculty. 
However, we must remember that students do not exist in a vacuum. Instead, they bring with them complex aspects that must be 
accounted for by the librarian in order to both understand the situation and provide adequate support. We must  also focus on teaching 
students to adapt first and foremost as things will change so that they can be successful in their future careers and not jus t on an 
individual project. Finally, we must embrace our interdisciplinary natures and look to other fields  for best practices, theories, and 
methods based on our needs as teachers, collaborators, coaches, and mentors.

MIXING UP YOUR INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION : 
INTEGRATING DATA LITERACY INTO YOUR PEDAGOGICAL 
TOOLBOX   
DONNA HARP ZIEGENFUSS  
INTRODUCTION  
One glaring revelation that emerged from the  COVID -19 pandemic is an increased awareness  of data and data literacy. 
Daily exposure to charts and visualizations depict ing the scale and scope of national and international COVID cases, hospitalizations 
and deaths , has forever changed how we view the value  of data. Therefore, it  has become more important  now to help student s 
develop data literacy skills to ensure that regardless of their major , they are  prepare d for 21st century careers . This paper provides 
an argument for why librarians should  integrat e data-related  topics into  their information literacy teaching  and provides 
recommended pedagogical strategies.  As the importance of data and data decision -making intensifies , librarians need to develop 
new teaching strategies to adapt to changing priorities . Similar to  information liter acy, building data capacity requires not just 
teaching students how to find and critically evaluat ing data information , it also requires developing awareness  and a rationale for 
evaluating  data information . Consider ing how data literacy aligns to other  literacies  like visual  literacy, digital literacy , and 
metaliteracy concepts  is also important . Finally, librarians in these times of change need to move beyond teaching just information 
literacy and in tegrate  these other literacies , such as data lit eracy , into their toolbox of pedagogical strategies.  
 
DATA LITERACY : WHAT  AND WHY? 
You do not have to be a data science librarian  or a computing wizard  to teach data literacy concepts or integrate data 
concepts into your teaching.  Data literacy topics exist at a variety of levels.  D’Ignazio  and Bhargava  (2015) define data literacy as, 
“the ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data. ” Carlson and Johnston (2015) call for a broader approach to supporting 
the data information literacy needs of a new generation of learners and focus on teaching students to become more critical consumers 
of data, in ways similar to  the critical consum ption of  news, media, and research information.  A data literate individual is defined 
by the Oceans of Data Institute ( 2015 ) as one who :  
…understands, explains, and documents the utility and limitations of data by becoming a critical consumer of 
data, controlling  his/her personal data trail, finding meaning in data, and taking action based on data. The data -
literate individual can identify, collect, evaluate, analyze, interpret, present and protect data . (p. 2) 
 
Being able to find, manipulate , and analyze data goe s hand -in hand with the knowledge and skills we already teach  students  
about how to sift through and evaluate other  types of  information. There are similarities between teaching information literacy skills 
to unearth information evidence to support  academic arguments , and developing capacity to find and use data  to support arguments . 
There are repositories that store data  just like scholarly article databases . Trends are also emerging that recommend  teaching data 
awareness even down into the  K-12 levels. Using tools like Excel , along with  the ability to visualize and tell a story with data , are 
quickly becoming some of the most important 21st century skills.  A panel  of data experts from industry and K-16 academia (ODI, 
2015)  met in a global workshop  and created a report  to articulate how  data literacy concepts help define ‘well educated’ students . 
80       LOEX -2021    -ZIEGENFUSS - Their findings focus on developin g analytical thinking , defining research goals, “taking a difficult problem , breaking it down into 
pieces, and building it back up again to gain interesting insights ” and keeping an open but skeptical mind when analyzing data for 
patterns  (p. 8).  The follo wing sections in this paper provide some ideas and different ways to incorporate  these data-related topics 
into your information literacy teaching.  
 
CONNECTING DATA LITERACY TO OTHER EXISTING LITERACY FRAMEWORKS  
But how do you integrate data literacy into your information literacy instruction ? Most importantly, i t is recommended that  
you do not try to layer  data literacy on top of what you already do ; but rather  integrate  it into what you already do. First, l ook at how 
you currently rely on in formation literacy frameworks in your current teaching. Do you frame your teaching in a Digital Literacy 
framework ? Are you an arts librarian that focuses on the Visual Literacy framework ( ACRL, 2011 ) and presenting information 
creatively and visually ? Do you consider the Metaliteracy Framework (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014) as you plan instruction and use 
the four domains of metaliteracy? Do you design one -shot library instruction that adhere s to one of the AC RL frames? It does not 
matter wh ich model you use , but the point is  to have purpose in how data literacy topics are introduced or integrated into your 
practice. Table 1 is a crosswalk  matrix  of how the data literacy skills presented in the literature could align to  components of four 
different information literacy related models : the ACRL Frame work  (ACRL 2016), the Data Literacy Framework (Oxford, 2018), 
the Four Domains of Metaliteracy (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014), and the Visual Literacy Model (ACRL, 2011).  Grounding your 
instructional planning in frameworks or models will help you identify your purpose and priorities for your instruction and help you 
visualize the points of intersection for information and data literacy.

THREE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO INTEGRATING DATA INTO INFORMATION LITERACY TEACHING  
The three case studies below will provide three different approaches to integrating  data literacy into your information 
literacy practice. Each case include s both undergraduate and graduate student exampl es and resources at a variety of levels depending 
on your experience and comfort level with data literacy . Begin the integration process where you are  at. Teaching about Data, is the 
-MIXING UP YOUR INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION : INTEGRATING …- LOEX -2021        81 easiest way you can build student data awareness  about  data topics . In using a Teaching with Data approach ,  you can spotlight more 
specific data cases in scholarly articles, show examples of data visualizations and demonstrate how data are cited to support research 
arguments . The final case, Teaching Data Skills , would involve a higher level of data -related comfort and knowledge about  data 
management or data  analysis tools . Additional examples for thinking about integrating data can be found in at this supplementary 
website . I will use also an example of a  five-session embedded librarian case study  that I designed in the past  for a  social science 
undergraduate learning community course and describe  how the three different teaching with data approaches  were scaffolded across 
a semester -long course . A backward design process (Fink, 2013) and alignment grid (Appendix A) was used to collaboratively design 
the sessions with a faculty  partner . 
 
Case 1: Teach About Data 
As you teach information literacy skills, you can use article examples that contain an explicit data component  to build 
awaren ess of how data is used as research evidence. Some examples include:  
• Show  example s of how some articles contain supplementary data files  or rely on charts and tables   
• Highlight how authors use data in their scholarly papers in different ways such as creati ng charts and diagrams with their 
own research data, or how they use and cite other researcher’s data in their paper.  
• Spotlight what type of data authors use  (qualitative or quantitative) and how they discuss analysis of data in the methods  
and results  section s of their paper  
• Show how they cite data  
• For upper -level  undergraduates or graduate students, who may be collecting their own data for a capstone, thesis or 
dissertation, you can explain the data process es related to  collecting , managin g, and curating data  
• Provide guidance for  creat ing a naming conventions  scheme  for data files  or a ‘read me’ file to help with data organization  
• In the example of a five-session embedded library  session for students  conduct ing research about genetically modified foods 
(GMOs) , data topics were introduced by using an existing and public study from the Pew Research  website . This website 
contain s the survey, data results  from  the survey, and also provide s the report with the data analysis . This provided an 
example of how to conduct researc h around the perceptions of GMO foods  by collecting and analyzing survey data. Students 
worked in groups to brainstorm ideas for planning and implementing their own data collection process around GMOs based 
on what they had learned . See Appendix A —session #3  for more details on the data teaching activities and assessment.  
 
Case 2: Teach with Data 
There are many examples of research  studies with data already freely available that you can use to teach with data; you do 
not have to crea te a dataset yourself. You can : 
• Use data from a data repository  to talk about different types of data  
• Find a teaching case already out there on a topic relevant  to the discipline you are teaching  
• Present visualization s and then discuss the data story . The New York Times ’ website , What's Going On in This Graph?   is 
a great example of this  
• Use data examples to discuss primary vs. secondary data  
• Use data to i ntroduce a topic that students are studying   
• Use a dataset to demonstrate what a dataset looks like in a repository database such as the Census, data.gov, education 
statistics like NCES , or social science data collection s at the Inter -University Consortium for Political and Social Research  
(ICPSR ) data archive.  
• Introduce Tableau Public, a free data vi sualization tool  that has a gallery of visualizations  with some interactive  data 
displays  on a variety of topics  
• If you are t eaching graduate students, the Data Information Literacy (DIL) Project has a series of case studies  across several 
science disciplines with supplementary files such as data  management self -assessment s, rubrics and handouts.  
• Have students e xplore several data repositories and find a dataset  on their research topic and have students reflect on  how 
accessing and evaluating  data differ from scholarly articles in a database   
• Students can also search for infographics (by searching infographic:health disparities , for example ) in Google Images  to 
see how data are presented on their topic and then try to trace the data back to the original data source  
• In the embedded teaching plan in Appendix A, the Pew Research GMO data were used to introduce students to a quantitative 
data example.  They then explored other datasets and used what they found to help plan their own approach to data collection  
and survey design  
 
 
82       LOEX -2021    -ZIEGENFUSS - Case 3: Teach Data Skills 
This level of teaching data require s a higher  level of data tool skills along with needing additional time to work out the 
logistics of teaching a tool in your class  (so don’t start here unless you have some data experience ). This is the application and hands -
on level of teaching data. However,  you do not need to teach high -level Python or RStudio ; Excel will work just fine. Here are some 
examples:  
• You can also teach students how t o find and download data  and then report on th eir process and what they observe d  
• Explore visualization tools  and provide links to online tutorials about learning tools or self -directed modules like this set of 
modules  on learning how to use Tableau Public  
• For graduate students actually learning about data management skills, include instruction about how to create a research 
data management plan  for their research  using a free tool  (such as the DMPtool , which is s omething that will help them in 
the future when applying for grants ) 
• Provide a checklist to help graduate students doing dissertation s get organized and have a plan to manage data  
• In the last stage s of the data literacy related activity from the five-embedded library session , student s watched tutorials on 
how to use the Excel and Google Form s to create a survey and collect data . Even though student groups collected a small 
dataset, they were ab le to go through the complete process to identify a research question, conduct research, design a survey 
to collect and analyze data around their questions . They  then present ed their research and findings in a group presentation.   
 
LESSONS LEARNED  AND RECO MMENDATIONS FOR GETTING STARTED  
In trying to integrate data literacy and data skills in my regular librarian practice, I had to learn new tools and skills in order 
to teach them to others. This experience helped me to provide expanded  support for students. I have learned some lessons that I will 
provide here : 
 
• Start small and scaffold up. OERs are out there and available  to use; do not recreate the wheel ! Start small and scaffold 
up or build on what you are learn ing as you go . Start at the beginning and teach about data as an alternative option for 
finding evidence for a paper or presentation. Use the free Network of the National Library of Medicine (NNLM)  Data -
Driven Discovery  website to sign up for free webinars and online courses.  The NNLM Data Roadmap  (Figure 1) present s 
data resources and tutorials  in a scaffolded five -stage  format.  Each stage is  organized by librarian competencies  and 
provide s an opportunity to start where you are at and build expertise as you go  through the map . 
 
Figure 1 : NNLM data roadmap website : A scaffolded approach to learning about data  
 
 
 
• Build data knowledge for teaching . Use the NNLM Data Thes aurus  to learn data terminology . Be strategic as you learn 
about data topics and pick an area of interest to focus on rather than trying to learn everything about data. For example,  if 
you want to help students visualize data , focus on learning a visualizations tool.  Reflect on what you t each and build future 
learning based on your reflections . 

-MIXING UP YOUR INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION : INTEGRATING …- LOEX -2021        83 • Align data to your existing standards and frameworks . Use the crosswalk matrix  (Table 1) to find connections and 
intersections to your current teaching practice. Build on what you know  and already u se to align your data literacy activities.  
Read about the intersection of data competencies and librarian competencies ( Federer, Clarke  & Zaringhalam,  2020) .   
• Lean on your general librarian skills to develop new data skills . Teaching about data and data literacy is not just about 
data, you can build on your traditional librarian competencies to enhance how you teach about data. Use this Quality Course 
Framework  (QCF) Four step process to plan and design your instruction making sure you have considered what you hope 
students will know and be able to do at the end of the instruction.  Discuss your data literacy ideas with faculty partners 
using this teaching guideline document  to help facilitate t he faculty -librarian discussion and communication.  Do you have 
a data librarian at your institution? Consider co -teaching a session and draw on that expertise.  
• Explore and experiment . Jumping into teaching data topics and data literacy may seem different f rom information literacy 
teaching. However,  look for the similarities and take time to explore data resources and experiment with lesson plans. Start 
with the easy tools —like learning more about Exce l, or start with teaching about qualitative data . Practice using these new 
tools for work -related data projects  first (e.g., library assessment)  to build confidence  before moving them into your teaching 
practice.   
• Teach data to learn about data. Last but not le ast, learn about data as you teach with data . Remember the old saying about 
the best way to learn  is by teaching ? Develop a plan or timeline to identify strategic data literacy or data topics to explore 
and teach.  This will help you ‘chunk out’ your time and help you see progress on your skill sets and knowledge as you 
move through the timeline.

MOUNTAINEER STORIES : GROWING AN APPALACHIAN STATE 
UNIVERSITY FIRST-YEAR ORAL HISTORY PROJECT  
MARK COLTRAIN AND KIM SIMS 
AUTHORS’ NOTE 
 This paper is a sequel to a paper written by Coltrain and published in the LOEX 2020 Conference proceedings. It was the 
result of a canceled lightning talk from the 2020 conference . 
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
 Located in Boone, North Carolina, Appalachian State University (“App”) is  a four -year public institution that is part of the 
University of North Carolina System. App’s enrollment is overwhelmingly composed of undergraduate students. Despite the 
COVID -19 pandemic, Fall 2020 enrollment exceeded a university goal of 20,000 student s and of those, 3,906 were first -year students 
(Appalachian State University facts , n.d.). App’s commitment to recruiting and retaining diverse students continues apace with 
various initiatives targeting a number of groups. In Fall 2020, 18% of students we re members of racially and ethnically 
underrepresented groups ( Appalachian State University facts , n.d.). The percentage of other populations like first generation and 
rural students is also significant —both demographics sit at 31.7% and 36.7%, respectivel y, in Fall 2020 (Institutional Research and 
Planning, n.d.). With those students come stories about what it means to be a ‘Mountaineer’ —experiences that are largely absent 
from the official record of the university.  
In Fall 2019, the App University Archiv ist and First Year Experience Librarian decided to start an oral history project 
focused on first -year students. The pair also plan to interview the same students again in their senior year. The idea came about 
because of their mutual interest in oral hist ory and documenting current student experiences to subsequently house in the University 
Archives, which largely lacks such voices. After several meetings, they decided to identify courses in the University’s First  Year 
Seminar (FYS) program that thematical ly complement such a project and approach the instructors about possible collaboration. The 
FYS program is one with which the librarian already works closely. This outreach resulted in an initial ‘pilot’ partnership w ith an 
FYS instructor who teaches a cou rse on comparing societal issues and advancements using H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine as a 
springboard.  
In Spring 2020, the librarian, archivist, and instructor integrated a newly developed assignment into the course. First, 
students engaged with external oral history interviews. Then, after an instruction session from the librarian and archivist, students 
paired up to record audio interviews with each other. Finally, students transcribed the interviews and wrote reflections on th eir 
experiences. Students did not have to participate in this assignment and had the alternative option to write a research paper . Students 
also had the option to participate in the project but not sign the release form granting permission for the interview materia ls to be 
transferred to the University’s Special Collections Research Center. Despite these necessary limitations and the challenges presented 
by the pandemic, the pilot project proceeded and was largely successful. Nearly all of the students in the class participated , signed 
release forms, and indicated the experience was worthwhile in post -interview reflections, despite a f ew challenges getting the release 
forms in a timely manner. As a result, the instructor enthusiastically committed to participating again in Fall 2020.  
 
88       LOEX -2021  -COLTRAIN  AND SIMS- Since the project’s development and implementation, a more cohesive set of goals have emerged to guide it:  
• Diversify, enrich, and challenge current/longtime ideas, beliefs, and overall narrative of App  
• Connect students to longer history of Mountaineer experience, creating engagement and belonging via the curriculum and 
archives  
• ‘Inclusify’ the curriculum b y incorporating interviews, starting with First Year Seminar and a focus on diverse populations  
• Document how the Mountaineer experience changes from students’ first year to senior year  
 
Evidence of achievement of these goals will be offered in the form of:  
• Recordings and transcripts of the student interviews  
• Analysis of the interviews by the First Year Experience Librarian, University Archivist, and/or relevant partners  
• Curricular and extracurricular research projects or creative activities by other student s that incorporate or utilize the 
interviews  
• Research or creative activities by faculty or staff at both App and at other schools  
This paper will offer a brief overview of the beginnings of the project but, to reduce redundancy from the earlier paper, will primarily 
focus on the 2020 -2021 academic year, take a closer look at the implications of establishing and growing a collection of interviews, 
and discuss future goals .   
FALL 2020 -SPRING 2021  
 In light of pandemic -fueled uncertainties and conc erns, Fall 2020 classes at App were held exclusively online. Spring 2021, 
on the other hand, was a mixture of online and in -person offerings. While the librarian and archivist thought they might have a new 
FYS instructor/course partner in Fall, it was dela yed until Spring. The instructor they worked with in Spring 2020, however, had 
already agreed to continue participating.  In terms of how things went with this course in Fall compared to Spring, nothing c hanged 
significantly: most students participated and  opted to have their interviews transferred to the Special Collections Research Center.  
A new idea came from the archivist’s research, however, and that was to anonymize student recordings, transcripts, and 
other documents in the soon to be created collec tion, identifying students only with their initials. This idea came from Johns Hopkins’ 
First-Generation College Student Oral History Project. The archivist felt it would protect vulnerable students and possibly increas e 
participation from any who might be  uncertain. The intent to anonymize materials is something that the librarian and archivist 
incorporated into their presentations to students.  
With the arrival of the Spring 2021 semester and new FYS instructor/course, “Our Appalachian Community,” meant a  new 
set of circumstances (the previous instructor volunteered his course again, as well). Course enrollment in Our Appalachian 
Community is restricted to Student Support Services students —these students qualify for the federally funded TRIO program, which  
is designed to support disadvantaged students including those with disabilities, low income students, and/or first -generation students.  
The course already had elements of interview and storytelling so the oral history assignment meshed quite well. The 
assignment was largely unchanged except that, unlike the other course, participation in the project was not optional, though sig ning 
the release form still was. The librarian, archivist, and new instructor also added some interview questions to the pool from  which 
students drew, though students still had the option to come up with some of their own (see Appendix 1). Another new element w as 
an emphasis on asking follow -up questions. An observation from previous semesters was that students rarely asked follow -ups, so 
the librarian and archivist added content to their presentations to focus on the importance of this interview technique.  
Overall, things went well with the new course, as well as the other course that was still participating. COVID -19 was an 
obvious theme of the interviews —particularly students’ exhaustion with online learning. Despite those challenges, students shared 
positive and honest experiences from their first year, as well as stories of perseverance. The new course offered some fresh 
perspecti ves from the more diverse group of students, including the following highlights from their post -interview reflections:  
• “I definitely feel that this helped us reflect on each other and on the Appalachian community which is literally the name of 
our class.”  
-MOUNTAINEER STORIES : GROWING AN APPALACHIAN STATE UNIVERSITY …- LOEX -2021       89 • “I honestly wish I was able to watch or listen to other students' interviews before coming to Appalachian State. I feel like I 
would've known what to expect and how to be a little more prepared.”  
• “It was pretty intimidating especially with how class is to day not actually being there to see facial expressions and read 
body language you basically only have the tone of voice to go off of.”  
• “Although my interview may not have been perfect I feel that if someone was to hear my interview 20 years from now they 
would take some very important points out of it. I hope they learn the importance of community, and how joining one will 
make the college experience better. The importance of having goals and having a plan to achieve them. Also, the importance 
of the past a nd how you can use what you have learned from those experiences to influence your future decisions.”  
         (Special Collections Research Center, n.d.)  
The librarian and archivist also solicited feedback from the instructors (only one responded as of thi s writing):  
This was absolutely a valuable experience for my students. It helped create community and empathy in my classroom. 
Students saw how much they had in common with their peers and got to know them on a deeper level than your average 
classroom chat ter. 
Students had a few suggestions for how this assignment could be improved. I think the biggest thing they wanted were 
questions that got at bigger ""life"" things or were more personal. The scope is to focus on student life, but I think they wan ted 
to dig in a bit more. We also got a few suggestions about making this a group interview so you got to know more classmates 
and it was more of a conversation. I already taught an interview section and it blends so well with my storytelling theme 
that I'm going t o really expand on this when I teach my sections in the fall again.  
        (M. Fitzgerald, personal communication, April 29, 2021)  
CREATING A COLLECTION IN THE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES  
 One of the project goals was to increase the student voice within the university narrative, especially students from 
marginalized communities. The librarian and archivist agreed at the beginning of the project that creating an archival collec tion of 
the or al histories would be the way to go. In order to create a collection, however, there had to be students willing to sign the r elease 
form. The release form serves to formally transfer a student’s audio interview, their interview transcript, and their projec t reflection 
and make them available for research. The interview materials will only be transferred to the Special Collections Research Ce nter 
and made accessible with a signed release form in place. The materials created by students who opted not to sign a release form will 
not be added to the archive and will be kept at the discretion of the professors.  
For the interviews that do have a release form, the librarian transferred the files (audio, transcript, reflection) from AsUL earn 
into a Google Drive fold er shared between him and the archivist. The library’s digital preservation specialist will eventually be given 
access to the folder so that he can copy the files into the Special Collection Research Center’s dark archive for permanent r etention 
and preser vation. In the interim, the archivist is making access copies. The access copies are being redacted in order to retain studen t 
anonymity. For the transcripts and reflections, names are replaced with initials. The audio files will be edited to remove id entifying 
information before being made public. For the time being, the archivist is not editing the transcripts to correct grammatical  errors or 
misspelled words.  
The archivist started drafting a collection guide for the collection, which is formally called the “Mountaineer Stories Oral 
History Project.” While adding in the file names for the interviews has been easy, providing access to the anonymized transcr ipts 
has proven more difficult. While the transcript can be uploaded as a digital object into the col lection guide, it must be stored on a 
server the collections database can access, and as of this writing, App campus IT has not approved the request for server spa ce. 
Eventually, however, the librarian and archivist expect that the transcripts, audio files , and reflections will be accessible online 
through the collection guide without having to physically come into the Special Collections Research Center for access. As of  this 
writing, the collection guide is still in development . 
CHALLENGES  
 Thus far, the project challenges have been relatively small but not insignificant and are mostly related to technology. 
Probably the biggest challenge has been getting signed release forms. It is not that students don’t want their interviews to be a part 
of the archival collection, rather, it’s either getting students to remember to sign the forms or troubleshooting technologica l barriers 
they encounter when trying to complete the forms. This is an instance where paper would be better than digital but, due to this being 
90       LOEX -2021  -COLTRAIN  AND SIMS- conducted online, electronic forms have been the primary option. Hopefully, when classes return to in -person, this challenge will 
subside.  
Another challenge has been inconsistencies in both the audio and the transcript file formats. Despite it being clearly stated 
in the directions and the librarian making himself available to help, some students have used other recording methods besides  the 
agreed upon interview recording tool, Cleanfeed. The librarian and archivist plan to work with instruc tors in the future to require 
usage of specified programs and equipment, as audio quality has been inconsistent, as well. In regards to transcripts, admitt edly, 
guidance on format was missing from the instructions. Moving forward, more instruction on trans cripts and a requirement for them 
to be submitted as PDFs is planned. Additionally, spelling and grammatical errors are recurring issues with the transcripts —this is 
something else that the duo will discuss with faculty partners to mitigate issues in the f uture.  
A final challenge that is starting to emerge is the lack of sustainability in terms of project coordination and management. 
This project has been a ‘labor of love’ for the librarian and archivist but as more courses participate and as more interview s 
accumulate, having a third person on the team to help manage and process files, especially, will be crucial to the long -term success 
of the project. The archivist has discussed the creation of an oral historian position, but that is not currently feasibl e due to budgetary 
restraints. Moving forward, that is a goal to pursue as well as the development of a maintenance plan. There are additional i deas and 
considerations for the future that the two have discussed, as well . 
THE FUTURE  
 After conducting this p roject for a full year in the online environment, the librarian and archivist are excited to (tentatively) 
return to their original plan of conducting it in -person using the library’s audio studio in Fall 2021. Since the studio is a controlled 
environment,  hopefully formatting and audio quality issues will be minimized. However, since things have functioned well online, 
overall, having that as an alternative option is useful.  Additionally, the pair wishes to pursue project grants and create m ore of a web 
presence for the project. The archivist also wishes to expand the project to include other students via campus clubs, organiza tions, 
and events —grant funding could make that goal possible if it could cover the cost of something like a mobile recording booth . Of 
course, having an oral historian on staff would also go a long way to making that idea possible.  
The primary future goal, however, is reestablishing contact with as many students as possible who participated in this in 
their First Year Seminar classe s when those students are seniors. It is the hope that those students will agree to be interviewed again 
to reflect back over their years at App and look ahead to their plans after graduation. If that can be accomplished with even  a sizable 
percentage of s tudents, along with the creation of a publicly accessible collection that is included in the First Year Seminar 
curriculum, then this project will be considered a success .

Oral History Assignment: UCO 1200  
Step 1  
You will listen to, read, or watch 3 oral history interviews of their choosing from StoryCorps  and/or Wolf Tales  and write a one -
page reflection. Questions to consider when writing the reflection:  
● Why did you cho ose these particular interviews? What makes these interviews special to you?  
● What is one thing you learned from the person being interviewed? Why is it important?  
● Did you observe any techniques that will inform how you will conduct your interview? If so, p lease explain.  
● Is there anything else you would like to know from the interviewee or anything you wish the interviewer had asked? Please 
explain.  
Step 2  
The FYE Librarian and University Archivist will visit class for an instruction session to introduce the assignment (including  the 
release forms), train students on oral history techniques and best practices, discuss interview questions, and walk through l ogistics.  
Step 3  
You must choose 9 questions or you can choose 8 and come up with your own 9th question (per instructor approval). Then, you w ill 
interview each other during our interview day (around 15 -minute interviews per student), transcribe interviews,  and share with your 
partners for accuracy.  
Step 4  
You will also write a final essay reflection of the experience (2 -3 pages) or record a 5 -7-minute podcast. Lastly, you will upload the 
audio file(s) of the interview and accompanying transcripts to AsULea rn. Questions to consider when writing your reflection of the 
interview experience:  
● What was this experience like for you as an interviewer? What was it like being interviewed?  
● Why did you choose these questions to ask your partner?  
● What did you learn abou t your partner? What did you learn about yourself?  
● What would you do differently if you were to do this project again?  
● If someone listened to your interview 20 years from now, what do you hope they learn?  
● What final thoughts or observations do you have abo ut this project?  
 
Interview Questions:  
Must ask:

PERFECTION ISN’T THE GOAL, RIGHT ? REFLECTIONS FROM 
EARLY -CAREER LIBRARIANS ON ADAPTING THE ONE-SHOT TO 
AN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT  
LEAH FREEMON , CHRISSY O’G RADY  AND MARIA SCLAFANI  
INTRODUCTION  
 The COVID -19 pandemic has altered the way we teach and learn. It has forced our institutions to shift to online learning, 
close our libraries, work from home, and limit our in -person interactions. On a more personal level, it has caused us to experience 
loss, pain, isolation, and b lurred the lines between work and home responsibilities. This life altering experience has caused us to 
expand our pedagogical approaches to focus on a sense of care for ourselves, our students, and our colleagues.   
This paper is based on an interactive pr esentation at the LOEX 2021 conference that reflected on the experiences of three 
early -career librarians from different universities as they pivoted from in -person to online one -shot instruction due to the COVID -
19 pandemic. This paper will discuss how ad apting our instruction to online environments developed and expanded our pedagogical 
toolkits by embracing a pedagogy of care for online education, the importance of student -centered instruction, and opportunities for 
critical growth through reflective pra ctices. Attendees were encouraged to reflect on their own experiences through a series of 
questions using Google Jamboard.  
PEDAGOGY OF CARE IN THEORY  
 Although the panelists have been practicing a pedagogy of care for many years, the way we practice carin g in our teaching 
changed in response to the pandemic. As Mehrotra (2021) observes,  “though as educators we often make a clear distinction between 
our own experiences and that of our students, COVID -19 blurred those lines as we were all part of a collectiv e experience” (p.539). 
As we adapted to unfamiliar ways of teaching, learning, living, and working —all of which impacted our well -being —the importance 
and value of caring pedagogy became increasingly clear.  We revisited the early scholarship on ethics and pedagogies of care, and 
were surprised by how fully it resonated with our current experiences. For the purposes of this paper, a ‘pedagogy of care’ a nd 
‘caring pedagogy’ are synonymous terms understood to involve the practice of an ethic of care in a teach ing context. Based on our 
review of the scholarship, we have identified three core principles of a pedagogy of care: care and student engagement are pr ioritized, 
care is relational, and caring requires a holistic approach to education.  
 The first principle  requires the act of caring itself be prioritized. As Noddings (2003) observes,  “the primary aim of every 
educational institution and of every educational effort must be the maintenance and enhancement of caring” (p.172). Likewise, the 
teacher must prioritize engaging with the student:  
when a teacher asks a question in class and a st udent responds, she receives not just the ‘response’ but the student...She is 
not seeking the answer but the involvement of the [student]...The student is infinitely more important than the subject 
matter . (Noddings, 2003, p.176)  
94       LOEX -2021   -FREEMON , O’G RADY  AND SCLAFANI - Although this principle se ems simple, our educational institutions, for the most part, do not prioritize caring, and often we are not 
taught to practice a pedagogy of care, if we receive any instructional training at all.  
The second principle refers to the nature of care as fundame ntally relational, meaning that it involves interaction between 
two or more people. The developmental psychologist Carol Gilligan (1993) explains that an ethic of care, “which reflects a 
cumulative knowledge of human relationships, evolves around a central  insight, that self and other are interdependent” (p.74). 
Furthermore, the relationship between self and other is necessarily reciprocal: “care becomes a medium of, ideally, mutual ex change, 
whereby self -interest is blended with the interests of others. By  investing in the personhood of others, one's own personhood is 
advanced” (Traschel, 1995, p.33).   
The third principle requires a holistic approach to education, which takes into account the whole personhood of both student 
and teacher. In Teaching to Tran sgress , bell hooks (1994) argues that “progressive,  holistic education,  ‘engaged 
pedagogy’...emphasizes well -being. That means that teachers must be actively committed to a process of self -actualization that 
promotes their own well -being if they are to tea ch in a manner that empowers students” (p.15). We, as educators, must take care of 
ourselves first before we can take care of our students. We must, as Maria Accardi (2013) says, “secure our own oxygen mask before 
helping others secure theirs” (p. 93). If we neglect our own well -being, we risk burnout and creating an imbalance in the classroom 
where we require more of our students than we do of ourselves (hooks, 1994, p.21). The importance of this principle was throw n 
into sharp relief by the pandemic.   
At LOEX 2021, after reviewing these principles, a ttendees were then asked to use Google Jamboard to engage with the 
question s “Which core principles of caring pedagogy resonate most with you? Why?”  
PEDAGOGY OF CARE IN LIBRARY INSTRUCTION  
 A number of  librarians have engaged in bringing pedagogy of care into library instruction. Accardi (2013) cites Thayer -
Bacon and Bacon to define a caring teacher:  
a caring teacher is personal, takes the time to get to know students, treats students as valued participants and collaborations 
in the learning environment, helps students learn to believe in themselves, is affirming and nurturing, fosters a safe and ki nd 
learning environment, and develops a respectful trusting relationship with students . (p. 45)  
The idea that students are participants and collaborators can be a challenge in library instruction with limited time and little 
relationship building between instructor and students. Many librarians interact with students for only one session and are no t involved 
in curriculum planning or research assignment design. Noddings (1984) asserts that a pedagogy of care doesn’t require creating a 
long-lasting relationship with all students, but rather being “totally and nonselectively present to the student —to each student -as he 
addresses me” (p. 180) , which we can do in a one -shot session . We are also often tasked with teaching far more content than we 
have  time for. Although one -shots can feel like a race to get through content, we have to remember to prioritize en gaging with the 
student over covering all the content. It is also easy to fall back on a point -and-click pedagogy that designates us as experts and 
students as consumers. Pedagogy of care challenges us to do better and bring our students into the learning process through student  
centered instruction strategies.   
Pedagogy of care is challenging to implement successfully in a face -to-face classroom setting, but is even harder to achieve 
in an online environment. As educator Colette Rabin (2021) notes, “intera ctive opportunities are limited for practicing caring, 
particularly authentic caring” (p. 40). The difficulty of creating relationships with students in a one -shot is even further hampered 
by an online environment. However, research indicates a number of i nstructor strategies for bringing care into an online classroom, 
such as  “instructor vulnerability, promptness, humor, and eagerness [which] contributed to increased student interactions, 
motivation, engagement, and better learning outcomes” (Rabin, 2021, p. 40). Additionally, there are a number of activities that have 
been identified as caring, such as “synchronous activities; peer -to-peer support through groupwork; projects drawing on students’ 
interests; options for representing learning; solicitation of  student feedback; and, relevant and simplified resources” (Rabin, 2021, p. 
42). Librarians tasked with online instruction due to the pandemic drew on this and other research to create synchronous and 
asynchronous content that showed care towards students.  
How We Put Pedagogy of Care into Practice  
 At one panelist’s institution, asynchronous online instruction has been highly encouraged as a more accessible approach to 
the online environment. This approach considers students’ personal lives and mental health during a pandemic. Many students' home 
situations may not allow for stable internet access or dedicated class time, so the asynchronous material allows for more flexib le 
engagement. The activities presented in research modules were relevant to the assignments students were being asked to comple te. 
This respects students' time by not asking them to engage in activities that are not productive to the goals of the course. T hey can 
clearly see the benefits of the assignments. These asynchronous activities were also mutual learning opportunities. The st udents were 
-PERFECTION ISN’T THE GOAL, RIGHT ? REFLECTIONS FROM …- LOEX -2021       95 asked to engage with each other in peer learning, and the librarians were able to learn more about the students’ research pro cess and 
strategies than from a traditional in -person class. This exemplifies the care is relational principle of carin g pedagogy by 
demonstrating that we can and should learn from each other.  
 At another panelist’s institution, a pedagogy of care approach was focused primarily on teaching librarians. The teaching 
librarians group, consisting of 10 librarians, decided to o nly offer remote instruction starting in Fall 2020. The format of the 
instruction was left up to the librarian, providing flexibility based on online teaching comfort and capacity. Drop -in sessions were 
established for teaching librarians throughout the fa ll semester to provide a space for discussions, idea sharing, and reflection. A 
topic often discussed in these drop -in sessions and in informal conversations were how to quickly establish rapport with students in 
online instruction sessions. One approach s ome librarians embraced was a quick and fun opening prompt. An example of a prompt 
is “what was your favorite cereal growing up?” These prompts were answered by the librarian, students, and the instructor in the 
chat feature of a synchronous session and pr ovided an opportunity to establish connection before jumping into a lesson.   
 At the third panelists’ institution, the flexibility faculty were given to select a course delivery format resulted in a mixt ure 
of in-person, synchronous and asynchronous classe s. This created a lot of confusion for instruction librarians, who received requests 
for all three formats in Fall 2020. The confusion and stress caused by figuring out how to provide instruction in a safe and manageable 
way prompted librarians to reconsid er how they practiced caring pedagogy. After some uncomfortable conversations and 
experiences, they learned to only offer remote instruction and emphasize the importance of advance notice in campus email dig ests. 
The third panelist primarily provided synch ronous instruction, so she focused on developing strategies for engaging with students. 
She discovered building a variety of activities into her lesson plan allowed her to pick and choose which ones to use in the session 
based on students’ responses. Forms , surveys, tutorials, and other activities were designed to be easily modified and reused, so the 
amount of prep required for sessions decreased over the course of the semester. Activities ranged from brief mindfulness exer cises 
to asking students to answe r questions about their research and then following up with students or the instructor after the session.   
After this overview of each panelist’s institutional response, a ttendees were then asked to engage via Google Jamboard with 
the question “How have yo u implemented student -centered instruction online?”  
REFLECTIVE TEACHING PRACTICES  
 We’ve experienced unprecedented change in our personal and professional lives due to COVID -19. By embracing reflective 
practices, librarians and library workers can grow fro m our experiences over the past year and expand our pedagogical toolkits as 
educators. As Nicole Cooke (2020) articulated well, “when we examine ourselves and commit to learning and growing in new ways , 
we are better for it, and our pedagogy can improve an d expand as a result” (p. 89).   
Reflective practices can be a means for growth and development for librarians who teach, especially when a pedagogy of 
care is utilized.  Hibajene Shandomo (2010) describes reflective practice as “a process of self -examinatio n and self -evaluation in 
which effective educators regularly engage to improve their professional practices” (p. 103).  As Saunders and Wong (2020) describe, 
we probably already engage in some form of reflection, but there is a difference between casual and  formal reflection. A casual 
reflective practice can include taking a moment after a teaching session to identify when students were confused or disintere sted. 
The goal of more formal reflection should be “intentional and analytic, and we must apply what w e learn from our reflection to 
inform our practice” (Saunders and Wong, 2020, p. 248).   
 Educators have taken the basic definition of reflective practice and expanded it to incorporate critical theory. Brookfield 
(2017) defines critical reflection as “the sustained and intentional process of identifying and checking the accuracy and validity of 
our teaching assumptions ” (p. 3). Brookfield argues that our assumptions can be viewed through four lenses: students; colleagues; 
personal experience; and theory. Th e way reflection becomes critical is when we focus on understanding power and hegemony 
(Brookfield, 2017, p. 9). Librarians and library workers can benefit from incorporating critical reflective practices alongsi de a 
pedagogy of care into our librarianship  practice. Nicole Cooke (2020) described her own journey with critical self -reflection by 
describing it as a p rocess  “that facilitated the strengthening and deepening of my critical library instruction and pedagogy ” (p. 86).  
 Reflective practice is useful and beneficial regardless of what approach to teaching you take or how much teaching you do. 
It can help us think and learn from a teaching experience, an interaction with a colleague or student, and even determine our  capacit y 
to do something. Saunders and Wong (2020) outline a four -step process introduced by York -Barr et al. in 2006 as a way to develop 
a systematic reflective practice. Step one involves thinking about “what happened?” before moving onto step two , which is the  
“Why?” After the why, comes step three the “So what?” and step four the “Now what?” As Saunders and Wong (2020) articulated 
so well, this four -step process “encourages us to reflect on our actions and to use reflection as a step toward taking action” (p . 248).   
 After this overview of key tenets of reflective practice, attendees of the LOEX session were then guided through two 
reflective questions using Google Jamboard, keeping in mind the four -step process that Saunders and Wong outlined,  and the 
pedagogy  of care practices explored earlier in the session. Attendees were asked “be honest with yourself, how has this year been 
96       LOEX -2021   -FREEMON , O’G RADY  AND SCLAFANI - for you? How has it affected your teaching?” The purpose of this question was to highlight the importance of self -care during a time 
of uncertainty and acknowledge how it impacted our roles as teaching librarians. Attendees were then asked  “please share a time 
when an instruction session or instruction activity has not gone as planned and how you used (or plan to use) that experience  to 
further develop your instructional practice.” The purpose of this question was to collectively practice critical reflection to 
demonstrate that “good reflectors move beyond description of an experience and begin to identify problems or questions, gathe r 
information to address the questions, study the issues and the gathered information, and make sound decisions for further actio n 
based [on] this act of studying” (Goodsett, 2014, p 12).  
CONCLUSION  
We have found that adapting our instruction to online environments due to COVID -19 developed and expanded our 
pedagogical toolkits. By embracing a pedagogy of care, we have a better understanding of our own needs, and the needs of our 
colleagues and students. By focusing on student centered instruction, we de velop relevant learning activities regardless of mode of 
instruction. Lastly, by embracing critical reflection, we use experiences and assumptions to grow and enact changes in our 
instructional practices.   
To end the LOEX 2021 session, a ttendees were asked  one last question : “We made all these changes because of the 
pandemic, but what are we going to keep when we ‘return to normal ’? How are we going to shift from emergency instruction changes 
to long term changes to our instructional design and practice? ”

PROBLEMATIZING THE ROLE OF INFORMATION LITERACY IN 
DISINFORMATION , DIALOGUE , AND THE HEALING OF 
DEMOCRACY  
SARAH APPEDU  AND MERINDA KAYE HENSLEY  
INTRODUCTION  
What happens in classrooms under the banner of information literacy has  to include an understanding of information 
systems … including the fact that these systems are social, influenced by the biases and assumptions of the humans who 
create and use them. Otherwise, educators and students will make no progress in healing our curr ent crisis of faith. (Fister, 
2021)  
 The proliferation of technology in the past decade has rapidly changed information behavior. In response, information 
literacy instruction has expanded to include critical practices to help students examine how biases s hape the finding and evaluating 
of information. However, librarians are now being called to address the ways in which information technology itself is laden with 
biases and the impact this technology can have on both the search experience and the material world.  In particular, t he threat of 
mis/dis/malinformation  (Wardle, 2019)  and biased search algorithms to democratic principles has become a concern for librarians, 
students,  and the everyday searcher. The conversation around the impact of artificial intel ligence, personal data harvesting, and 
search algorithms has been g aining attention —most recently in response to the mis/dis/malinformation campaign against the U.S. 
presidential election and the January 6th insurrection —and has created both the potential and the imperative to incorporate these 
topics into information literacy instruction. We propose integrating dialogic exercises into library instructional practice a s one means 
of accomplishing this goal.   
INFORMATION LITERACY AND DEMOCRACY  
 Several definitions of information literacy assert a relationship between the well -being of democracy and information 
literacy. The ALA made the following claim in 1989 in the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy  final report:  
How our country dea ls with the realities of the Information Age will have enormous impact on our democratic way of life 
and on our nation’s ability to compete internationally. Within America’s information society, there also exists the potential  
of addressing many long -stand ing social and economic inequities. To reap such benefits, people ---as individuals and as a 
nation ---must be information literate. (ALA Presidential Committee, 1989)  
 Other popular definitions assert this relationship as well. The Chartered Institute of Li brary and Information Professionals 
defines information literacy as “the ability to think critically  and make balanced judgements  about any information we find and use. 
It empowers us as citizens  to reach and express informed views and to engage fully with  society” (CILIP Definition of Information 
Literacy , 2018) . The Alexandria Proclamation says, “Information literacy … empowers people  in all walks of life to seek, evaluate, 
use and create information effectively to achieve their personal, social, occupati onal and educational goals. It is a basic human right 
in a digital world and promotes social inclusion  of all nations” (Beacons of the Information Society: The Alexandria Proclamation 
on Information Literacy and Lifelong Learning , 2005) . The association be tween information literacy and democracy is also supported 
   
 
98       LOEX -2021   -APPEDU  AND HENSLEY - by the ALA Core Values of Librarianship, which include “Democracy ”, “the Public Good”, and “Social Responsibility ” (B.1 Core 
Values, Ethics, and Core Competencies , 2010) . [emphasis added]  
Recently,  the ALA exploited this connection in their response to the January 6th insurrection, where they claim that 
“Libraries in America defend the constitutional rights of all individuals … We celebrate and preserve our democratic society  so that 
all individuals  have the opportunity to become lifelong learners and engaged residents” ( ALA Condemns Violence on Capitol Hill, 
Calls for Advocacy , 2021). [emphasis added]  However, the statement did not acknowledge the role librarians have in addressing 
mis/dis/malinform ation, bias ed technology , and racism in our practices, including information literacy instruction. Additionally, 
despite the association between information literacy and democracy, the word “democracy” is absent from the ACRL Framework 
for Information Literacy (2016),  which many librarians rely on to inform their instructional practice. These omissions beg the 
question: To what extent are librarians and our teaching practices living up to the expectation that information l iteracy contributes 
to “preserving democratic society”? One means through which librarians could achieve this expectation in our instruction is t hrough 
raising student awareness of  how technology can threaten these values.  
INFLUENCE OF TECHNOLOGY  
 Since i ts creation, Google has become both a popular source of information and a multi -billion -dollar  data aggregator and 
advertising company. Recently, scholars have revealed how companies like Google control, manipulate, and profit from the 
information we see o nline. In her bestselling book Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism  (2018),  Safiya 
Noble demonstrates the impact of algorithmic oppression, defined as “algorithmically driven data failures that are specific t o people 
of color and w omen” (Noble, 2018) . Noble found that Google’s search results reflected negative stereotypes of Black women, 
including some that have persisted since the practice of slavery and still contribute to the structural and physical violence  they 
experience. Her work serves as one example for how search algorithms have the power to further marginalize people that have 
historically been oppressed within the context of U.S. democracy, undermining the idea that search engines are “neutral .”  
Additionally, Eli P ariser  popularized the concept of “filter bubbles” in his book, The Filter Bubble: How the New 
Personalized Web Is Changing What We Read and How We Think  (2011). His work documents the ways  in which  platforms leverage 
their power to coll ect and analyze behavioral data to personalize online experiences and warns against the consequences of this 
system. He writes, “Democracy requires citizens to see things from one another’s point of view . . . a reliance on shared fac ts; instead 
we’re bein g offered parallel but separate universes”  (Pariser, 2011) . While the actual, demonstrated impact of filter bubbles has been 
found to be less  significant than  previously imagined  (Dubois & Blank, 2018) , the epistemological and cultural challenges that crea te 
the perception of alternate realities persist.  
Overcoming oppression is necessary  to work ing toward  a democracy that allows the equal participation of all people; 
understanding the capacity of technology to contribute to oppression can reveal the poten tial for incorporating critical pedagogical 
practices around this topic into library instruction. Dialogue as a pedagogical tool can serve to both alleviate the impacts of 
algorithmic oppression and reinforce librarians ’ commitment to democratic principles .  
DIALOGUE AND CRITICAL PEDAGOGICAL PRACTICE  
 At the core of critical pedagogy, students are taught to question existing social, political and cultural institutions. One 
method through which librarians incorporate these principles into their instruction i s through critical self -reflection, including critical 
questioning, thinking, and evaluating. The development of the ACRL Framework from the original Standards reflects this 
commitment, encouraging the use of critical self -reflection throughout the documen t. For example, each ACRL frame includes 
dispositions, which “describe ways in which to address the affective, attitudinal, or valuing dimension of learning ” (ACRL, 2016).  
Several of the dispositions require students to engage in some form of critical self -reflection; the frame “Authority is Constructed 
and Contextual” includes the disposition, “develop awareness of the importance of assessing content with a skeptical stance a nd with 
a self -awareness of their own biases and worldview” (ACRL, 2016) . While se lf-reflection is a crucial component of critical 
information literacy, many of the dispositions are focused on the individual searcher and do not encourage critical engagemen t with 
the search infrastructure itself. Dialogue offers a useful schema for demys tifying the seemingly passive, neutral search engine and 
for helping students recognize the potentially anti -democratic nature of information technology.  
Radical educators such as Paulo Freire have argued that dialogue raises students’ “critical consciousn ess” so they can 
participate in co -creating the conditions of liberation needed to overcome their oppression. He also claimed that if students do not 
become aware of their own exploitation, they will have no choice but to accept their conditions. Even in 1 968, Freire was concerned 
about technology’s potential to further reinforce social inequality. He writes, “More and more, oppressors are using science and 
technology as unquestionably powerful instruments for their purpose: the maintenance of the oppressiv e order through manipulation 
and repression” (Freire, 2017 , p.34). In an attempt to distinguish  between  discussion and dialogue, for our purposes, we turn to 
Nicholas Burbules (1993), who defines dialogue as a more structured  activity  than discussion. He elaborates that “Dialogue is guided 
   
 
-PROBLEMATIZING THE ROLE OF INFORMATION LITERACY IN DISINFORMATION …- LOEX -2021       99 by a spirit of discovery, so that the typical tone of a dialogue is exploratory and  interrogative” (Burbules, 1993 , p. ? ). Engaging 
students in dialogue requires the instructor to set a tone of reflexive discovery —rather than discussing issues of algorithmic 
oppression . The latter  may be overly complex and difficult to fully cover in a o ne-shot session,  and using exercises that involve 
dialogue can help students think critically about the  search experience  within a larger social  and technological  context.  
In his book, Discussion as a Way of Teaching , Stephen Brookfield (2012) argues that critical dialogue “remains an 
indispensable part of democratic education” while alluding to the idea that it “helps people see how their choices can either  perpetuate 
injustice and continue silence or contribute to growth or even emancipation” (Brookfield & Preskill, 2012 , p. 8). To address this 
tension within information literacy instruction, we propose that students should be in active dialogue with the search engine , the 
results, and the resources with which they interact. Since technology has continued to be used as a means of control, applying the 
practice of dialogue to our instructional praxis can raise students’ awareness of the oppressive forces behind search algorit hms and 
how to navigate them.  
IMPLEMENTING CRITICAL DIALOGIC EXERCISES  
 There are s everal ways librarians can introduce and model dialogic exercises in their information literacy instruction. First, 
librarians may frame the search engine not as a passive, neutral resource but as the other participant in a dialogue about ne gotiating 
meani ng and finding truth. If searching involves being in dialogue with the search engine, we might pose the problem of a situatio n 
where the algorithm “misinterprets” their search and does not produce the results the student had expected, as Noble experien ced 
when she began her research on Google. Critical questions we can ask students to reflect on include:  
• Whose worldview does the search engine represent?  
• How is it similar or different from your own?  
• How did the search engine decide which sources to includ e?  
• How would you try to get the search engine to show you what you wanted?  
These questions can reveal how search engines do not merely “misinterpret” search terms but are informed by particular worldv iews 
and values. Framing the search process as a dialo gue highlights the subjective nature of search results and the power of algorithms 
to control our understanding of the conversation .  
Students may also consider the results themselves as  being  in dialogue with one another. While the sources are represented  
as “information ,” often in the form of text, they are all created by people and exist within a social and economic context. For example, 
we may ask students to think about why the results are ordered in the way they are, including the impact of sponsored results and 
page ranking, and how that shapes their perceptions of the broader conversation around their search topic and which participa nt’s 
voice is most important. Framing the results as in dialogue with one another also allows students to consider the point of view of 
each source ’s creator, how they may be similar or different, and what factors may inform each of their perspectives. After addressing 
the biases within the platform and among the sources ’ creators, we can then ask students to consider what  perspective s they are 
bringing to the dialogue and how their biases may impact which result they select first, which they trust the most, and to wh at extent 
they will allow that source to influence their opinions. Some questions we might ask students thro ughout this exercise include:  
• If you could have a conversation with the author, what would you ask them?  
• What do you assume they look or sound like?  
• What kind of education and experience do you think they bring to the conversation? How does that impact your 
understanding of the issue?  
• How might your biases and assumptions impact your willingness to trust the author?  
Asking students to engage with the platform in this way can both raise student’s awareness about the unconscious choices they  are 
making w hile searching and the ways in which the search engine itself impacts their decision -making.  
Finally , students should be invited to engage in dialogic exercises with one another. Building on the work of Paulo Freire, 
Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed (1993)  uses theatre exercises to help people see themselves as agents of social change. 
While this text was created for those in the theatre, Boal ’s ideas can be helpful for thinking about creative ways to bring dialogue 
into the information literacy classroom. For example, students may work in pairs to read a short article about a particular t opic, 
whether that be related to the course content, current events, or whatever is relevant to the lesson. One student would assume t he 
role of the author, trying to understand their argument and thinking about what factors may inform the author’s conclusion. T he 
other student in the pair would assume the role of the reader, first forming their own opinion of the article’s contents foll owed by 
asking questions of the author with the aim of understanding their point of view. By engaging in dialogue with the author a bout why 
their points of view are similar or different, both students can reflect on how bias impacts information evaluation. The libr arian 
would end by facilitating a debrief to discuss the experience of each role. Some questions that could be asked of th e students include:  
   
 
100        LOEX -2021   -APPEDU  AND HENSLEY - • How did the author form their understanding of their argument?  
• Was it easy to answer the questions based only on the information they read in the article?  
• How was the reader’s opinion similar or different to the author?  
• Did their opinion of the argument change after the conversation?  
Throughout the search process, dialogue and critical reflection are both essential tool s to help students become aware of 
their own biases and assumptions and to begin to understand how technology itself is an active participant in the search proc ess. 
Raising students’ critical consciou sness through dialogue can bring our instruction closer to our goals of preserving democratic 
principles by addressing the power of technology to  reinforce oppression and  threaten those principles.   
CONCLUSION  
 By teaching students about issues related to  technology, democracy, and information through critical dialogue and self -
reflection, we expose the complexity of searching and demonstrate how students  can be empowered to take the search experience 
into their own hands. The instructional exercises we ha ve outlined can be adapted and used by teaching librarians to encourage 
students to reconsider what it means to find and evaluate knowledge within our current social, economic, and political climat e. Doing 
so is not a passive, solitary activity but happens  in dialogue with and in relation to technology, society, and their fellow searchers. 
Embracing a dialogic approach to information literacy instruction is but one way to begin intentionally incorporating the pri nciples 
of democracy into our instructional p ractices.

‘REMEMBER THE LADIES’: UNCOVERING THE VOICES OF 
TENNESSEE ’S SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT THROUGH PRIMARY 
SOURCE INSTRUCTION  
JENNY HARRIS AND NICOLE WOOD 
INTRODUCTION  
A common  challenge with teaching one -shot instruction sessions is engaging students and creating meaningful dialogue 
that will extend beyond the session(s).  With 2020 marking the 100 -year anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, 
librarians at Austin Peay State University’s Woodward Library decided to use the centennial  as a mark er for building information 
literacy sessions where students locate d, analyze d, and interpret ed primary source documents surrounding the women’s suffrage 
movement . The library has a well -established relationship with the Women’s and Gender Studies Program , thus we collaborated 
with the coordinator of the program to develop two 75 -minute instruction sessions using the Tennessee Virtual Archive  and other 
resources as the focus of locating relevant primary sources. The goals of the sessions were to  1) teach st udents to evaluate the original 
source and 2) spotlight the inequities within  the women’s suffrage movement itself.  
By applying feminist pedagogy practices t o the instruction sessions, students participated in  discourse  that moved beyond  
the issues of gender inequality that are centered  solely on white women and challenged the suffrage movement as we know it for its 
lack of inclusion and oppression of women of color (Fritch, 2018). Through these sessions, s tudents uncovered and analyzed primary 
sources rel ated to local suffragists and anti -suffragists not commonly recognized in the historical narrative, and, by interpreting 
unambiguous propaganda posters  and text -based sources , such as letters and newspaper clippings,  they learned to draw personal 
conclusio ns about primary source materials without the assistance of secondary and tertiary sources.  
FOCUS ON THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT  
On August 18, 1920, the Tennessee House of Representatives ratified the 19th Amendment by a narrow one -point margin, 
making Tennessee the final vote required  to add an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. With the 100th anniversary of women 
gaining the right to vote, we wanted to highlight the importance  of the suffrage movement in the U.S. by specifically connecting it 
to local history , while also encouraging students to become active in the democratic process.  The introductory course for women’s 
and gender studies se emed like a natural place to do this.  
Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies (WGS 2050) meets the requirement at Austin Peay State University for a 
social and behavioral science course as part of the General Education core. It  is also the first course taken by students who minor in  
women’s and gender studies. Students enrolled in the course are typically  first or second year scholars  who are  still developing 
research skills and may not have prior experience using the library’s resources.  Furthermore, th e course is interdisciplinary in nature 
and combines women’s and gender studies, African American studies, and history, creating a  desirable  setting  for integrat ing an 
assignment focused on the suffrage movement.  The original assignment for WGS 2050 requires students to research a marginalized 
historical figure from any point in history . We collaborated  with the professor to restructure the assignment , asking  student s to focus 
their research on a suffragist or anti -suffragist  and to incorporate two primary source documents into their final assignment.  Because 
we wanted to help students identify voices that have traditionally been left out of the women’s suffrage narra tive, we thought the 
104        LOEX -2021   -HARRIS  AND  WOOD- most authentic way to learn about this historical movement was to amplify  the voices of the overlooked  figures  who participated in 
it. 
PLANNING THE SESSIONS  
 Since the sessions were comprised of primarily  first and second -year students , some of whom were conducting primary 
source research for the first time, we wanted to ease them into their primary source analysis. This was done by incorporating  both 
visual resources , which included  political cartoons and propaganda , and text -based resources , such as newspaper articles and 
pamphlets. Opening the discussion with a visual example allowed students to critically engage with the archival material in a format 
that is more appealing than a block of text.   
During the first instruction session, we opened  with a  poll activity using Poll Everywhere. The idea was to gauge what 
perceptions and ideas students had about women’s suffrage prior to discussing and analyzing historical documents. We also  
wanted to show them how to use brainstorming for keyword searching. Students were asked to submit answers for the question , 
“What word(s) do you associate with the suffrage movement?” Some of th e responses included:  women’s rights , feminism , voting , 
equality, resilience , strong, and power. T he most common words were  then used as search terms for a database demonstration.  
 
Figure 1 : Word  cloud of keywords students associate with the suffrage movement   
 
 
The primary database of focus for the instruction ses sions was the Tennessee Virtual Archive  (TEVA) , which  serves as a 
digital repository for Tennessee’s history and culture . It provides background information and context  for each collection  it houses  
and offers an easy -to-navigate interface, allowing collections to be browsed by subject, creator, or media type . Since  students were 
researching less er-known historical figures, we recognized the potential need to consult a variety of sources. Therefore, we also 
briefly discussed other databases a nd archives, including the Women’s Studies Archive: Women’s Issues and Identities , Women and 
Social Movements in the United States, 1600 -2000,  and the University of Chicago’s Ida B. Wells Papers.   
 
Interpreting Primary Sources  
To get students comfortable w ith evaluating primary source documents, we asked students to interpret both visual and text -
based resources. The purpose of this instruction technique was to encourage students to draw their own conclusions about prim ary 
sources without depending on secon dary or tertiary interpretations ; students were also urged  to disregard the  mindset  that there was 
a “correct ” response.  
First, we  shared a political cartoon that students selected for interpretation. Unlike a lengthy pamphlet or newspaper article, 
the car toon clearly stresses the m essage the artist wanted to convey. The image depicts a  happy mother reading about the passage of 
the 19th Amendment, while the rest of her family, including the cat, cower in fear . Without consulting any external sources for 
context, students  answered the following questions:  
• What can we deduce about the artist/author without looking up any additional information?  
• What opinions did this person likely have about the suffragist movement?  
• Does this cartoon/article raise any questions that you want to research further?   
The students then used the se guided questions to deduce that the image clearly contained anti -suffrage sentiments , and they 
unanimously expressed their wish to further investigate the image.   

-'REMEMBER THE LADIES ': UNCOVERING THE VOICES OF TENNESSEE 'S…- LOEX -2021       105 Figure 2: Anti -Suffrage cartoon published in the New York Tribune, 1920  
 
 
The political cartoons/propaganda acted  as a warmup for the main primary source analysis. After interpreting the visual 
findings, students wo rked in small groups to analyze  text-based information, such as letters and newspaper articles . They responded 
to the same questions, drawing their own conclusions about the authors and the authors’  thoughts about women earning the right to 
vote. By this p oint in the research process , students were already actively engaged in the material, and they could use the visual 
resources for comparison and contrast.  
The next image students were asked to examine depicts an African  American woman who has struck  down the Grandfather 
Clause  denying suffrage to African Americans  and is now battling  Jim Crow law s and se gregation. The cartoon, titled ""Woman to 
the Rescue!"" was published in the African American periodical The Crisis  in May 1916 . 
Figure 3: Political ca rtoon published in The Crisis, 1916  
 
 
While the cartoon was originally created in support of both women’s suffrage and Black suffrage, it also appears in an anti -suffrage 
pamphlet that suggests  permitting Black women to vote would be a threat to white supremacy.  Examining  this particular political 
cartoon  and accompanying text  through a modern lens, while being confronted with the reality of the historical viewpoint , provided 
a much more jarring and impactful experience than simply reading a schol ar’s analysis in a journal article. Overall, we found the use 

106        LOEX -2021   -HARRIS  AND  WOOD- of political cartoons as an entry point  into source evaluation and analysis  to be an effective method for engaging students with 
primary source materials.  
APPLYING FEMINIST TEACHING PRACTICES  
Accardi  (2013) writes in Feminist Pedagogy for Library Instruction , “Not only is feminist pedagogy concerned with 
subverting patriarchal subject matter, but it also is concerned with the way any subject matter is taught” ( p. 25). Our focus with this 
assignment was to decenter ourselves in the classroom, to encourage students to take control of their learning, and to empowe r them 
to draw their own conclusions about the primary resources that were evaluated . Therefore, we wanted to g ive them an active role in 
each stage of the instruction session, from keyword brainstorming to resource analysis.   
 
A central aim of this assignment was to amplify unheard and/or marginalized voices in the movement.  While we did mention  
the role the National Women’s Party (NWP) and its’ founders, including Alice Paul, played in achieving their goals of women 
gaining the right to vote , it wa s vital to note that women of color played a significant role in the movement, though their stories  often 
go untold. Activists such as Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell, both of Memphis, TN, were two local figures who fought against 
racism while battling  for the right for all women to vote. Fritch asserts that, “Th e combination of ensuring intersecti onality is included 
within the content of each academic discipline and what we are teaching our students to teach is an important aspect of criti cal 
feminist theory” (2018, p.4). We wanted students to consider the way gender and race discrimination collide d during the suffrage 
movemen t and to recognize the parallels with ongoing efforts to achieve equality.  
 
Ultimately, we desired  to put students in control of their own findings  and reinforce the idea that a failed search is expected 
at times, which is why we search again ; we re-search. We hoped to inspire students to see those failed searches as an opportunity 
for further investigation  and as a way to hone in on more specific qu estions and discover the true stories behind many forgotten and 
disregarded texts . 
REFLECTION  
Upon reflection, we realized many factors were successful, but there is still room for improvemen t in our teaching practices 
and in the content we share with stud ents. For example, t rying to fit our learning outcomes in one session would have been 
impossible. Because the sessions were held over two c lass periods , students had time to reflect on the first session and come to the 
second session prepared to continue t he conversation . Students w ere engaged with content and with one another , and they were 
especially interested in the visual components and being able to analyze what they saw . On the other hand, the space constraints of 
the computer lab in which we met for class made it difficult, at times, to facilitate active learning experiences, which occa sionally 
hindered some students’  ability to engage with the ma terial. Furthermore , our assessment efforts were informal and relied on 
feedback from the course instructor; therefore, we do not have much data to determine how the library instruction impacted each 
students’ knowledge  of and applicability of the research process .  In futur e ses sions , we will invite  students to reflect on their 
experience by asking:  
• How will you use the knowledge gained?  
• How will you t ake the skills learned in the instruction sessions and apply them  to research in other disciplines?  
Additionally, p olitical cartoons on this topic primarily depict white  individuals . In an article highlighting critical pedagogy 
in library instruction, Fritch writes, “The practice of speaking back to the oppressive ideology that prevails in our society  through 
storytell ing of real lived experiences empowers those in society who are marginalized and frequently silenced” (2018, p. 1). This 
project was intended to uncover unheard voices from this movement , and while we did introduce students to suffragists of color, 
much ca n be done to improve the  outcomes of  sessions in this respect. While TEV A contained very few  political cartoons featuring 
suffragists of color , there are a number of political cartoons and propaganda from this time that do; they are just a little more diff icult 
to find. However,  future sessions will centralize and utilize such resources. Examples of websites that can be used for these searches 
include “What is a Vote Worth?” (http://whatisavoteworth.org/ ), which is maintained in a partnership between the Frazier History 
Museum, Jefferson County Public High Schools, the Metro Louisville Office for Women, and various civic organizations. Additio nal 
visual primary sources can be found on Hathi Trust  (https://www.hathitrust.org/ ) and the Library of Congress website.  
CONCLUSION  
Using the 19th Amendment as a roadmap for the discovery and analysis of primary source documents in an introductory 
women’s and gender studies course p roved to be a successful method to motivate  first and second -year students who have little 
knowledge of the research process, as the assignment required them to engage with research and with each other , thus building a 
solid foundation for future collaborative research projects . Likewise, the assignment connected students to materials that encouraged 
critical thinking and inspired them to reconsider what equality means outside the historicall y-prominent narrative . 
-'REMEMBER THE LADIES ': UNCOVERING THE VOICES OF TENNESSEE 'S…- LOEX -2021       107 Librarians in a learner -centered e nvironment are focused on what the learner (student) will learn during the sessi on; think 
objectives or learning outcomes. But a feminist -centered environment is concerned with what the learner does with the knowledge 
acquired beyond the classroom setting (Accardi, 2013). From personal experience  as students , having instructor s that cared about 
what we learned made us care about what we learned. So, while our instruction sessions were  learner -centered, they were also 
conducted from a feminist approach. This, of course, makes librarians more vulnerable in the classroom, but it also makes us more 
intentional. We attempted to equip students with the tools to be in control of what they learned —to find their own voice and draw 
from experiential knowledge — which w ill hopefully resonate  with them beyond the library sessions, beyond the course, and beyond 
their academic careers.

SYLLABI STUDIES TAKE TOO LONG!: AUTOMATING A TEXT 
DATA MINING APPROACH TO INSTRUCTIONAL OUTREACH  
AMY JAMES , JOSHUA BEEN AND BETH FARWELL  
INTRODUCTION  
 Curriculum mapping can help to identify your library’s instructional reach as well as reveal potential opportunities for 
increasing instruction and new information literacy partnerships with faculty and instructors across your campus. Sarah LeMire and 
Stephanie Graves  (2019)  provide the following explanation of curriculum mapping : 
Curriculum mapping is a technique that visually represents curricular data, such as learning out comes, level of instruction, 
and library instruction statistics, to improve program analysis. Libraries commonly use it as a method for illustrating 
connections between library instruction and the university curriculum, determining overlaps in library inst ruction, and 
identifying opportunities for increasing instruction. (p. 274)  
Baylor University Libraries’ Director of Instruction and Information Literacy was interested in using curriculum mapping 
as a tool to work with individual liaison librarians from w ithin the Research and Engagement department to determine opportunities 
for engagement with faculty in their departments through information literacy instruction. During the fall of 2020, the Direc tor of 
Instruction and Information Literacy partnered with the Director of Data and Digital Scholarship and the Director of Arts and Special 
Collections Research Center to embark on a long-term curriculum mapping syllabi study. We decided to start with gathering syllabi 
from the Museum Studies department  because o f its size and because of the close ties the department has with the libraries.  
GETTING STARTED  
 The insight that we hoped to gain from this study wasn’t much different from  the prominent syllabi studies historically 
done in academic libraries (see works c ited). However, our project differed because we planned to automate the process.  The 
library liaison to the Department of Museum Studies worked  with us to come up with  some language that we would use with 
faculty to describe the project , emphasizing that we would not be evaluating or critiquing the syllabi or their instruction. We 
explained that we were looking for  opportunities where we could provide support  to faculty  and instructors through information 
literacy instruction . 
 
Then, we crafted  a list of  information literacy terms and concepts as well as  indicators for  levels of information literacy  
that each term  was associated with in relationship to our library’s tiered approach to information literacy instruction. The terms 
that we selected came from scanning a variety of different course syllabi, looking at assignments, and scanning for important 
vocabulary within the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy.   
 
The Director of Data and Digital Scholarship created a Python script to  mine  the syllabi for the pre -defined  information 
literacy related  terms and concepts. The algorithm works by identifying, based on their location,  two components : 1) action verbs 
in conte xt with 2) the research -related nouns  within ten words from the verb(s). The second component is mapped to one of the 
three tiers of information literacy based on the verb found and it does not consider the noun. This technique allowed us to s pecify 
which level of information literacy the syllabi may have referred to. We selected the following  nouns : library, collection, data, 
110        LOEX -2021   -JAMES , BEEN  AND FARWELL - project, paper, source, archive, theory, and component. We selected t hese verbs : evaluate, gather, synthesize, research, analyze, 
explore, identify, examine, and apply.  
 
We created  an interactive  data visualization that liaison librarians can use  as a tool  to help provide targeted information 
literacy instruction outreach within their departments.  The data visualization tool not only links to the syllabi collected but is also 
connected to the library’s instruction statistics. This allows the liaison to filter the data to see which classes  in their department 
have information literacy concepts within their syllabi, which of those c lasses  have received information literacy instruction in the 
past two years, and which ones do not have information literacy concepts in them  at all  (and therefore may not be good candidates 
for information literacy instruction).   
 
COLLECTING  SYLLABI  
One of the first challenges we encountered in this project was gathering syllabi.  Baylor University does not maintain a 
repository of syllabi and there is no university -wide expectation to collect them.  To test the tool, we needed a handful of syllabi to  
start.  W e approached the Museum Studies Department as a pilot group based on  the relatively small  number of faculty and strong 
ties to the library through several projects.  We received  eleven  syllabi to start.   The School of Education was our next area  to 
approach .  We were not able to collect very many from this group , despite  multiple attempts through emails to key faculty, 
notification sent through the department head, and numerous follow ups.  
Our next approach was to investigate mining the syllabi ho used in Canvas , our course management system .  After several 
conversations with IT and others, we received initial permission to use this data —but this plan ultimately was not approved with the 
rationale that we did not have permission from faculty to use their content.  We do have hope that if our initial project results are 
successful, we will be able to approach this option again.  
We were discouraged that we could not work in Canvas, but soon we received a big break through the Art s & Science s 
Core Curriculum group who have gathered syllabi for all courses in the core.  The A rts and Sciences ’ Dean’s office signed off on 
using these syllabi for our project with the caveat that we do not publish any information that might identify a particular fa culty  
member . 
After this good news, we also learned that one of our liaisons discovered the Department of Religion keeps current syllabi 
and we received approval to use  two years of content.  
RESULTS  
While we have access to library instruction data with the  Museum Studies department, there was still a lot about their 
courses and assignments tha t we did not know.  Using Microsoft Power BI allowed us to see combined data points and understand  
where activity was occurring with possible information literacy goals . After a review of the results, we decided to focus on two 
classes.    
The first course we looked at was MST 5318  (Ethical Issues in Museum Collections Management) . We wanted to work 
with a course that would be well -suited to information literacy support , but as a graduate course had room for additional information 
literacy support.  This course  is a graduate course that was previously combined with an undergraduate section. The course will now 
be taught just as a graduate course and this is an ideal time to build in information literacy research modules as the professor is 
building course objecti ves. We are currently meeting with the professor to talk through options.  
The second course we decided to work with was MST 5311  (Issues in Museum Administration) . This course did not show 
up at all in the results —no instruction,  and no matching terms. We were tempted to ignore this course, but knew it was one of the 
core courses required for the degree, so we decided  to take a closer look. There is a required paper,  and our plan is to build a library 
basics module.  
While there is still work to be done  in identifying the best path forward with departments, this  tool gives liaisons  a portal 
into a department ’s activity. We were  able to  physically see gaps and  opportunities for more partnerships in building information 
literacy instruction.  
LOGISTICS  
Automatic ally identifying new instruction opportunities for subject liaisons is a two -step process.  First, the syllabi must be  
mined for I L concepts. To accomplish this, w e created a publicly available  and open -source  Python Jupyter Notebook. This 
Notebook, named S yllabi Information Literacy Miner  (SILM) , is hosted on Google Colab and can be used directly through a web 
-SYLLABI STUDIES TAKE TOO LONG!: AUTOMATING A TEXT…- LOEX -2021       111 browser  with n o installation or coding required.  Second, the output from SILM  is combined with our Springshare  LibInsights 
instruction database  in an interactive  Power BI  data report. This data report allows our subject liaisons to identify syllabi with IL 
components that we have not done instruction for. However, as it is configured for the specific format of Baylor University’s  
LibInsights database, this tool is not available to the public.

https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/EYYX7L . A Jupyter Notebook is an interactive Python environment where code, data, and multimedia 
can be analyzed, visualized, and documented in a web browser. Google Colab provides free Jupyter Noteboo k functionality. As the 
Colab  in the name implies, it supports  collaboration and sharing.  While we coded SILM in Python , this tool can be used online 
without touching or even seeing any of the code.  To see the underlying Python code, simply  click the more options button on the top 
right corner and click Form/Hide Form.  
The primary Python libraries used in SILM are textract ( https://textract.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ ) and antiword 
(http://www.winfield.demon.nl/ ) to convert provided syllabi to text , pandas ( https://pandas.pydata.org/ ) to work with structured 
tables, and matplotlib ( https://matplotlib.org/ ) to generate visualizations.  
SILM goes through five steps to identify IL concepts in syllabi. First, syllabi can be provided by uploading or providing a 
URL to a .zip archive. Syllabi can be provid ed in PDF, Word (.docx or .doc), or text file formats. The Notebook will then convert 
all files to text. After converting files to text, IL components are identified by locating specified verbs within context or  within 
proximity to specified nouns. Next, t he IL tiers of Library Basics, Library Research, and Research in the Disciplines are assigned 
based on the identified verb. At this point, visualizations are generated,  and a downloadable Excel report is automatically 
downloaded.  
There are five configurable settings  on the Jupyter Notebook, just beneath the documentation.  We set these default settings 
as optimized for mining Baylor University syllabi, but j ust about everything can be adjusted. The first time someone uses SILM, a  
copy of the Note book is automatically saved to the user’s  Goog le Drive , so any adjustments to the settings will apply solely to the 
user’s copy.  The six configurable settings are (1) upload syllabi or provide link to url, (2) action verbs , (3) nouns that must be within 
context of the action verbs, (4) which verbs align with each IL tier, and (5) context size . 
When completed, four visuals are available directly below the output, along with an automatically downloaded Excel file.  
The first visual is a pie chart showing the p roportion of IL components found in each tier.  Next, a column chart is created showing 
the counts of verbs located with a noun within context. Next is a displayed  table showing the uploaded syllabi  and which tiers were 
identified in each syllabi.  Next , the most granular output  is displayed . This is a table with each row representing an identified IL 
component. The first column is the identified verb. Next the file. Next the full context. The last three columns specify  which tier the 
verb is aligned with.  Finally, t his granular table is downloaded  as an Excel file . 
Power BI Data Report (Baylor University Only)  
The Microsoft Power BI -generated d ata report  is the web application that subject liaisons at Baylor University  will use to 
identify new opportunities.  Its purpose is to connect the IL components identified using SILM with recorded instruction events as 
stored in Baylor University’s Springshare LibInsights database  so that courses , that the library has not recently provided instruction,  
can be identified with IL outcomes . At the time of this LOEX presentation, this data report contains two years of Core Curriculum 
syllabi from the College of Arts & Sciences,  Department of Museum Studies syllabi, School of Education  syllabi, and Department 
of Religion syllabi.  
Power BI is a business intelligence tool used to visualize analytics and dashboards. The data report is available via a web 
browser. Power BI is directly connected to Baylor’s Active Directory, so liaison librari ans must authenticate in order to view and 
interact with the report.  
The data report uses a matrix visual to provide subject liaisons with the ability to drill down  and explore for new instruction 
opportunities.  The department and course number of syllabi are listed with identified Information Literacy components. A count of 
the number of IL components found per course for each tier are listed in the next three columns. In the final column, the dat e of the 
most recent library instruction session for that co urse is listed.  The listed course can be drilled down to the identified verbs, the full 
context, and the full syllabi file name. Additionally, subject liaisons can export the content to a downloadable Excel file . This Excel 
file is similar to  the output from the Jupyter Notebook, but also includes  the date of the last instruction.  
112        LOEX -2021   -JAMES , BEEN  AND FARWELL - Power Query M , the preprocessing language available in Power BI , is used to clean and combine the output from the Jupyter 
Notebook and the LibInsights instruction data. Power Query M is analogous to  OpenRefine for Power BI data models. This query 
is automatically repeated with any data update or refresh.  
LESSONS LEARNED  
 Once we began trying to collect syllabi from individual departments , we realized the response rate  would not supply data 
at a scale we had anticipated . This prompted us to begin looking at additional ways to harvest syllabi  and resulted in acquiring 
access to the Arts and Sciences Core syllabi .  
 
Because Baylor is a private institution, syllabi are not collected or made available internally or externally. This was the  
biggest challenge that we encountered. Many faculty that we spoke to about th e project  expressed concerns about where the syllabi 
might be share d, despite us reassuring them that they would not be used for anything outside the project scope . We were able to 
work with the Arts and Sciences Core to gain access to the syllabi that were already collected . That involved an approval process,  
and it took the library Dean writing the Arts and Sciences Core Director to ensure that the syllabi wouldn't be used for anything 
else. We also have discovered through our Religion & Theology liaison  that the religion department maintains a Box folder wit h 
syllabi over several semesters . We were able to speak directly with the department chair and gain access to those folders as well  
through the established liaison relationship .

THE LONGITUDINAL BELLY FLOP WITH A SPLASH : LESSONS 
LEARNED , DATA GAINED   
CAITLIN BAGLEY , KELLY O’B RIEN -JENKS  AND NICOLE GUSTAVSEN
BACKGROUND  
 At a midsize private liberal arts college located in Spokane, Washington, library faculty made connections with one of the 
new Engineering professors in 2017. The professor taught an engineering course, ENSC 191, that was designed to reach every 
freshman e ngineering student at the university. Sensing an opportunity, library faculty worked with the professor to design a 
longitudinal assessment to check in with the same students in their senior year to see what concepts they had retained and wh at had 
changed in their knowledge during the time between. However, what actually happened in practice was that the instruction session 
went as planned with the freshman students, but time passed and by the time the senior year class was booked and we looked ba ck 
to see exactly what we wanted to recreate, the original assessment data was not to be found. Not only was the information itself 
missing, but there had been organizational and staffing changes —including retirements, sabbaticals, and the hiring of a new STEM 
librarian in 2019 —that affected follow through on the project. All of this, while somewhat unexpected, could have been better 
prepared for and addressed by a good data management plan. This article is a reflection on what we did wrong and how we salva ged 
a ruin ed assessment, but more importantly, what could have been done by others to prevent a longitudinal failure —focusing on 
research data management .  
(INTENDED ) METHODOLOGY  
 Before the Fall 2019 semester began, librarians met with the engineering professor to map the ACRL Framework onto the 
learning outcomes used by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), the accrediting body for the 
engineering school. We used this as a measure to find the shared values between the two fields, and to find a way to focus our 
instruction and assessment on the perceived needs of the engineering school. The designed assessment was intended to be a pre - and 
post-test given to  students in both their freshman and senior years. The idea behind the design was that these two scores could be 
used as comparison to see how well the students retained information and what they learned over the course of their academic career. 
Likewise, we wanted to see what information still had value to them by the time they were in their final year at the university. At 
the time of this project, engineering was an area that was being underserved by the library. Hiring a STEM librarian in 2019 was a 
decision made in part to address these issues of departmental need. Reconstructing the original instruction and assessment from what 
fragments we could find, we were able to find the original engineering articles from a variety of sources that we had asked s tudents 
to read, as well as a list of questions about the articles to get a sense of how they interpreted each article as to its acad emic merit, 
credibility, and what informational need it satisfied. There were also portions of our testing tools that had st udents rank each article 
by its perceived audience, be that a scholarly article, popular magazine, field literature, or an internet blog. The idea was  that students 
would become familiar with the differences between source types, and in which context each of them was useful .  
LONGITUDINAL ASSESSMENT  
 One of the best tools for conducting longitudinal assessments is to create a research data management plan (RDM). These 
plans ask researchers to track how their data will be collected, preserved and shared for years down the line and reflects the changing 
nature of research data. Many government funding agencies —such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of 
116        LOEX -2021  - BAGLEY , O’B RIEN -JENKS  AND  GUSTAVSEN - Health (NIH), and National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) —have been driving ag ents in requiring researchers to use RDM 
plans. Although our research was not funded by an outside agency, we could have benefitted from the structure provided by an 
outside agency. Our plan had been to assess the freshman class of engineering majors in Fa ll 2017, and reach out to them again in 
their senior year in 2020. When we first came up with the idea for our assessment, we knew what data we were looking for and how 
we would gather it on the front end of the project. What we did not have a plan for was  how we would maintain and monitor the data 
that we gathered in the years between the two surveys.  Instead, we had an informal idea that our tests would show that fresh man 
engineering students knew a little bit about information retrieval and sourcing acc urate material, but would not be able to distinguish 
between the specifics of trade journals and scholarly material, and we expected that after instruction this knowledge would i ncrease. 
Our curiosity hinged on retention, in that we were unclear on whether  or not the students would still hold this knowledge into their 
senior years. This was in part because prior to the hiring of the STEM librarian, most engineering students did not receive i nstruction 
after their freshman year. RDM is largely content -agnost ic, in that the material you’re collecting is not as significant as how you 
plan to maintain it.  
In the fall of 2020, in part due to the enthusiasm of the new STEM librarian, we remembered our long -dormant assessment 
project and began the initial steps of what we assumed would be finalization of the project. During the time in between 2017 and 
2020, we had a few instances at the beginning of school years when we would check in to see what needed to be done on the pro ject. 
The project had been approved by th e Institutional Review Board in late 2018 and during the intervening years, members of the IRB 
Board contacted us to confirm that the project was still underway. We assured the IRB that the project would be completed on time, 
but we did not think in that m oment to review where the project actually stood, either in terms of maintaining our existing records 
or making sure that we still held an idea of where things would go next. However, once we had the senior year class scheduled  for 
library instruction and the STEM librarian was there to remind us that we were about to teach to over 100 students, we realized that 
whether or not we had our original material in hand, we still had an amazing assessment opportunity that we would be foolish to 
bypass. We now had access to Qualtrics survey software, which we did not have access to three years earlier. We sent a link out to 
the students at the beginning of class to ask them two questions: 1) Do you recall attending a library session as part of your freshman 
year ENS C 191 course?  and 2) Have you ever had a library session during your time at Gonzaga that was offered in a non -
engineering course ? It was through this pivot that we were able to glean some important information about retention as well as figure 
out how we could redo the project in the future.  
The results of this simple assessment were not as complex as our original plan from 2017, but they still allowed us to glean 
insights. We learned from this that our students held a general memory of the original cours e, though we could not glean what they 
retained from the specifics of the course. The second question, however, told us the most revealing information, which was th at 
almost none of the engineering seniors had encountered library instruction outside of tha t provided as part of engineering courses, 
of which only two reliably include library instruction as part of the curriculum every year. This demonstrated a huge gap for  these 
students. We had a sense of this gap’s existence already, in that we knew how lit tle we were reaching specific engineering courses, 
but we didn’t have a clear sense of what the individual engineering student’s academic path was exposing them to. As things c urrently 
stand, the average engineering student is not receiving much informatio n literacy instruction of any kind. This information, backed 
now by our new data as well as our existing knowledge and intuition, will allow us to provide more and better instruction for  this 
growing community of students . 
LITERATURE REVIEW  
 Our focus when  reviewing the literature was on engineering assessments and the current ideas around research data 
management, particularly examples of the imperfect. Many studies looked at their research projects through the lens of federa l grants 
to see how well they w ere complying with RDM (Cummings et al., 2020), and using a mixture of focus groups and surveys they 
found clarity on how researchers viewed the help of RDM after the fact, and funder mandates had slowly created research pract ice 
change over time. Similarl y, RDM is not a new concept in the library field, but its adoption has been strengthened by funder mandates 
and new hiring of functional specialists like Scholarly Communication librarians that help drive home the point to faculty at  large 
(Cox, Kennan, Ly on, & Pinfield, 2017).  We found the work of Kristin Briney to be particularly informative in how librarians, as 
researchers, could apply their own methods to RDM as well as disseminate this to other researchers outside of the LIS field ( Briney, 
2019). In particular, she focuses on inadequate understanding of data management that can cause issues. To take a meta view of the 
greater context of RDM, we recommend the visualization work that shows how the conversation around RDM has changed over the 
course of t he past two decades (Zhang & Eichmann -Kalwara, 2019). Overall, the support for RDM stands strong among librarians, 
particularly among the STEM fields, but the work has largely been taken up in response to funder demands. There is still a ch ance 
of human er ror, like our own well -intentioned library -based research projects exhibited . 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
 After much reflection on where things went wrong with our assessment, we are committed to do the following in the future 
in order to prevent research failures li ke ours. As a part of any assessment plan, before any research has begun, a detailed RDM plan 
-THE LONGITUDINAL BELLY FLOP WITH A SPLASH : LESSONS…- LOEX -2021       117 should be implemented. This involves a multi -phased assessment that begins with a discussion of not just what the project’s aim is, 
but what type of data you want  to collect, and how it will be dispersed and maintained both during and after the project has been 
completed. The DMPTool (dmptool.org) is a tool that helps researchers new to the process create their own research data 
management plans that reflect the va ried requirements of individual funders and institutions. As this was an independent project, we 
did not need to take that under consideration, but going through the legwork can be helpful practice both for future research  as well 
as bringing our own skill s up to speed for helping our faculty across the institution when they come to us for help. We also 
recommend that if you fail or miss the mark on your intended assessment and information, take a look at what you do have avai lable 
and try to find the silve r lining. There may still be valuable ways to assess and gather information, even if it is not what you originally 
intended . 
CONCLUSION  
 We started out the project with big ambitions, but without a strong framework to support those ambitions. We had the gr ace 
to see what could be salvaged from memories and still -extant paperwork, but we likely would not have had to do such if we had 
built checks and structure into the process at the outset to keep our memories sharp. Our hope is that others might learn fro m our 
failures: not in that they never attempt longitudinal research, but rather that they build in the support systems that they n eed at the 
beginning in order to ensure that future success is not contingent only on (fallible) human memory. The literature firmly supports 
that data management plans work, but structure must be put in place in the beginning of a research project if you intend to e nsure 
long term success. Staffing changes created opportunities for paperwork and plans to become lost, but this ca n be prevented with 
succession planning and built -in reminders. Finally, opportunities come from realizing what options are available, particularly from 
normalizing your daily workflow into a strategic method of retaining information. Our failure was the e veryday failure of overloaded 
workflows and staffing changes that happen at every library, but our gain was in finding ways to navigate the failure into va luable 
data and we hope that you can learn from that in your own workflow .

TRANSFORMATION THROUGH COLLABORATION : ITERATING  A 
FIRST-YEAR LIBRARY SESSION TO ALLEVIAT E LIBRARY 
ANXIETY  
MICHELLE DEMETER , MARYBETH MCCARTIN  AND SARAH BETH BAILEY
INTRODUCTION  
Library anxiety is unfortunately alive and well at universities. At New York University Libraries, one way we have 
addressed library anxiety is by reaching students through first -year e xperience programs, especially the College Cohort Program in 
NYU’s College of Arts and Science. For several years, the Libraries have partnered with this program to develop and revise a library 
session, employing a continuous -assessment -and-improvement app roach.  
 
This article identifies strategies for collaborating on a first -year experience library session with external and internal campus 
partners. It offers insights about synthesizing several streams of assessment to inform the process of revising and o ptimizing the 
session iteratively. It also describes the current iteration of the NYU Libraries Cohort session, which focuses on alleviatin g student 
anxiety about the library and better understanding academic integrity, using a lesson plan that employs ele ments of visual literacy, 
guides active engagement, and incorporates the Libraries’ values of inclusion, diversity, belonging, equity, and accessibilit y. 
 
THE FIRST-YEAR EXPERIENCE COHORT PROGRAM  
 NYU has ten schools serving undergraduate students, the lar gest of which is the College of Arts & Science (CAS). The 
school’s College Cohort Program introduces CAS freshmen to college life and supports their retention and success. In any given 
year, the CAS freshman class is large —between 1,500 to 1,900 students —and a major goal of the program is to enable peer -to-peer 
connection and a sense of belonging by placing students into cohort groups. Each cohort group consists of 36 -40 students led by an 
academic advisor who is assisted by an undergraduate student mentor called a college leader. Throughout the year, the members of 
a cohort group regularly engage in formal and informal meetings and events. This includes a 75 -minute class every two weeks during 
which students learn about campus supports such as writing, tuto ring, health and wellness, and career services. One of these 75 -
minute classes is a visit to the library .    
NYU Libraries’ Undergraduate and Instructional Services department (UIS) has been involved with the Cohort Program 
since it began in 2013. Each fal l, we provide a library session for each cohort group, with the goal of reducing students’ library 
anxiety by identifying introductory resources and services, illustrating how to develop research questions, pointing out ways  to seek 
assistance from librari ans, and helping students better understand academic integrity. We conduct 50 class sections within a 10 to 
14-day timeframe during the busiest time of the semester —an intensive effort that requires significant planning, logistic al 
forethought , and human r esources. Success depends on strong collaborative relationships with colleagues in CAS and within the 
Libraries.  
 
120        LOEX -2021    -DEMETER , MCCARTIN  AND BAILEY - COLLABORATION AND LOGISTICS  
 NYU Libraries’ UIS department is small. Due to circumstances such as turnover and retirements, it typically consi sts of 
two to four librarians. For a team of such limited size, having committed partners has been essential to building and sustain ing a 
library instruction program  connected to first -year experience . Externally, our partner is the CAS Cohort team, consis ting of the 
program administrator (Assistant Dean of New Students), a college leader, and sometimes an academic advisor or first -year writing 
instructor. Internally, the partnership is with subject librarians who volunteer to teach some of the Cohort libra ry sessions.  
Collaboration with CAS  
 Planning for the fall library sessions begins in the previous spring semester. In March, the CAS Cohort administrator 
assembles a team, choosing a college leader and an academic advisor or first -year writing instructor.  The first meeting between UIS 
and the CAS Cohort team takes place in April with everyone bringing a draft of their learning outcomes and an idea of what su ccess 
would look like. The teams compare notes and settle on a common set of objectives and definiti on of success. During April to early 
June, the UIS and CAS teams work via email and a shared document to draft the lesson content, negotiating key concepts to cov er 
and ways to get students invested and engaged. Since this has been a long -term effort, evol ving over several years, there is no need 
to reinvent the wheel each time. Instead, we make an effort to use the previous year’s feedback data from students, college l eaders, 
and advisors to freshen and make improvements to the lesson plan.  
By mid -June, w e have a well -developed lesson plan draft that we share with all stakeholders for feedback. In July, we 
finalize the lesson plan and make any needed adjustments to our assessment strategy. Toward the end of August, college leader s 
come to campus for a trai ning camp to prepare for their overall responsibilities in the Cohort program. The UIS librarians present a 
segment about the library session, going over the lesson plan, which has traditionally included a role for the college leader  and the 
advisor.  
Collaboration with Subject Librarians  
 UIS is responsible for handling all the foundational library instruction provided for first - and second -year students. Besides 
first-year experience, this instruction is connected with such programs as first -year writ ing, first -year seminar, and freshman honors. 
This translates into about 300 classes per year —an unmanageable number for two to four UIS librarians. To cover these classes, UIS 
relies on the participation of five paraprofessional reference associates from various departments around the Libraries who, together 
with UIS librarians, constitute the “core instruction team.” This team covers the majority of the Cohort sections but not all , especially 
given that these sessions occur during the busiest time of the fall semester. For this reason, we ask about a dozen subject librarians 
to volunteer to teach some of the Cohort sessions.  
Subject librarians have challenging teaching loads of their own, so it is important to convey the benefits of volunteering 
and make participation as easy as possible. In recruiting, we remind potential tenure -track volunteers that participation counts toward 
the service record they need for tenure. We also portray it as an opportunity to learn first-hand  about the library instruction e arly 
undergraduates receive before advancing to subject librarians’ more specialized classes. To minimize the effort it takes to participate, 
UIS provides a uniform, step -by-step, “plug -and-play” lesson plan. Two weeks before the first Cohort session, UIS hosts a training 
session for all Cohort instructors, walking them through the lesson plan. To greatly minimize class prep time and ensure a un iform 
learning experience for students, library instructors are encouraged to deliver the lesson exactly as is. Th ey are given access to all 
class materials —lesson plan, slide presentation, learning objects, and end -of-class assessment survey —and are informed that UIS 
librarians will remain on stand -by for any questions and/or to provide additional coaching. They are also welcome to shadow a 
section taught by a UIS librarian before teaching their own section.   
ASSESSMENT AND REVISION  
Each year since 2013, the Cohort  administrator deploys a survey to students, advisors, and college leaders at the end of the 
semester to  get feedback about its overall fall programming. For several  years, this was the only survey used; but in 2019, the 
Libraries’ added two additional surveys. One is a brief end -of-session survey asking students about their perceptions of learning and 
engag ement, to get their feedback while fresh. The other is a survey for Cohort library instructors about the training, materials, and 
overall experience of participating in the Cohort sessions.  
 
  
-TRANSFORMATION THROUGH COLLABORATION : ITERATING …-    LOEX -2021        121 Figure 1: Quantitative Survey Data  
 
 
 
The most significant ch anges to the Cohort session were made between 2018 and 2020, and our analysis focuses on that 
period. In 2018, students (81%) and college leaders (82%) agreed that the session helped students become more familiar with library 
resources. However, only 70% o f advisors agreed with this statement, prompting us to devote more time in the 2019 and 2020 lesson 
plans to clarifying the Libraries’ core resources. Advisors’ responses showed notable improvement on this point in the 2019 and 
2020 surveys, suggesting tha t the lesson adjustments were effective. Concerning the CAS survey question about overall helpfulness 
of the library session, little change is seen between 2018 and 2020, with positive responses hovering between 76 -82 percent. (This 
question was on the 202 0 survey, but unfortunately responses were not recorded for students due to a malfunction of the survey 
instrument.) Regarding the academic integrity survey question, positive responses from students and advisors increased marked ly in 
2019, and held there in 2020.  
On the question of student engagement, it must be noted that results  of the CAS and Libraries’ surveys are at odds, making 
this a topic for future investigation. The CAS survey asks college leader s and advisors —but not students —about student engag ement 
during the session. Over the years , advisors and college leaders tended to note  a perceived lack of student engagement. That changed 
in 2019, when advisors ’ survey responses were significantly more positive on this question . However, results dipped again in 2020, 
with both the college leaders and advisors reporting lower student engagement levels, likely affected by the constraints of t he remote 
environment and “Zoom fatigue.” These perceptions contrast sharply the Libraries’ 2020 end -of-class survey findings, with 81% of 
students reporting that they felt engaged. This was the first year we polled students about their engagement, and we will con tinue to 
do so, as it presents a potential foil to the perceptions of those involved  in administering the session.  
 In addition to quantitative questions, the 2019 end -of-class survey invited open -ended feedback. The written comments 
pertained mostly to viewpoints about the physical tour of the library (part of the 2019 lesson plan) and t he overall quality of the 
session, as summarized below.  
   

122        LOEX -2021    -DEMETER , MCCARTIN  AND BAILEY - Figure 2: Qualitative Data from the End -of-Class Survey  
 
 
Regarding the tour, s ome respondents found it beneficial , but college leader s noted that many students skipped the tour and 
left class ear ly. Students ’ comments about the quality and usefulness of the session tended to be positive, while a dvisors and college 
leaders  noted that the success of the class depended on the individual library instructor. Library instructors took a separate survey, 
and their written comments are represented in the “Other” category. Their feedback indicated that they appreciated participating  in 
the lesson plan design  and that they would welcome opportunities for extra  training, including the possibility of conducting  a practice 
run before a peer audience . All of this feedback gives UIS and CAS much to consider going into planning for the 2021 Cohort 
sessions.  
RECENT ITERATIONS  
 The Cohort lesson plan underwent notable changes between 2018 and 2019, as evidenced below.  
Figure 3: Lesson Plan Summary for 2018 and 2019  
 
Besides the Cohort surveys, the 2019 redesign was informed by an adjacent survey administered by UIS to first -year writing 
faculty  in CAS , along with discussions with first -year writing program administrators about ways to differentiate the content covered 
in the Cohort sessions versus the first -year writing library sessions. Influenced by the survey and discussion outcomes, we decided 
to focus the 2019 session on the ACRL frame “Research as Inquiry .” One of the main challenges with the Cohort library session is 
that it is not attached to a research assignment since the Cohort class is not an academic course. In place of basing  the session around 
an assignment, we based  it around the NYU Common Read for that year —Educated , by Tara Westover. The main engagement 
activity involved brainstorming  keywords related to  themes in the book , and searching on those keywords in both Google and the 
library catalog to compare results and mine  further search terms. Moving on to the academic integrity portion of the class, advisors 
facilitated a discussion based on a few plagiarism scenarios. The session ended with a physical tour of the library,  led by the college 
leader.  

-TRANSFORMATION THROUGH COLLABORATION : ITERATING …-    LOEX -2021        123 Survey responses about the efficacy of the academic integrity piece were fairly positive in 2019, but some advisors and 
librarians expressed anecdotally that the plagiarism scenarios fell flat and sometimes posed more questions than answers. The 
keywords activity was a mixed bag, as some students did not see the relevance in looking up a topic they were not researching , and 
too much time was spent going over library resources that were not applicable to the students’ immediate ne eds.  
Figure 4 : Lesson Plan Summary for 2019 and 2020  
 
As usual, the 2019 feedback fed into 2020 planning, but the pandemic -driven shift to remote learning became the main 
factor influencing the redesign. Suddenly, the crucial  goal became developing a les son plan that would work in the Zoom 
environment . Since a tour of the building was not possible  under the circumstances , we gained more in -class time . This enabled a 
more well -rounded and less rushed session, with room for deeper discussions about research , library resources, and academic 
integrity. After a two -minute introduction, the library session began by placing students into Zoom breakout rooms for an ice -breaker 
asking them to identify an area in which they are an “unofficial expert.” The aim was to  show students that they have a place within 
the system of scholarship and that each has something they can speak expertly about. Students identified expertise in a wide range 
of areas, from pancake making to salsa dancing.  
Besides the pandemic, another m omentous event occurred in summer 2020, resulting in mass social upheaval —the murder 
of George Floyd, and the subsequent protests that erupted across the nation and the world. In light of this horrific occurren ce, the 
UIS librarians took stock of the Libra ries’ top strategic priority —the commitment to inclusion, diversity, belonging, equity, a nd 
accessibility (IDBEA) —and decided to include a practical application of IDBEA in the library session. This unfolded as a colleague 
from the CAS first -year writing p rogram suggested using visual literacy to engage students. After considering a few images, the 
photograph of Tommie Smith and Juan Carlos standing on the winners’ podium at the 1968 Olympics was chosen to help students 
understand the iterative process of g enerating ideas for research, and how asking questions drives finding related research materials 
in the library collection. To facilitate participation, the polling software Mentimeter was used to display the image and col lect 
questions from students about  the photograph .  

124        LOEX -2021    -DEMETER , MCCARTIN  AND BAILEY - Figure 5 : Sample of Student -Generated Questions Inspired by Photo  
 
 
After reviewing the submitted questions, the instructor displayed  a slide highlight ing books from the library collection 
focused on the 1968 Olympics, several of which u sed the same image but colorized or cropped in different ways to illustrate the 
perspective each author took on the same event. This allowed for a robust discussion of the inquiry process of taking a histo rical 
topic or image, relating it to the current moment , shaping it into a research question, and finding sources. After this activity, librarians 
provided an overview of the library website, highlighting the book search, virtual chat and other reference services, worksho ps, and 
research guides. For the academic integrity piece, we pivoted from using plagiarism scenarios to employing questions that addressed 
student opinions, feelings, and perceptions ab out cheating and plagiarism in an attempt to open a more nuanced conversation. We 
look forward to reviewing the 2020 as sessment data in further detail and reshaping the lesson once  again for Fall 2021.   

-TRANSFORMATION THROUGH COLLABORATION : ITERATING …-    LOEX -2021        125 APPENDIX A 
Library Les son Plan for CAS College Cohort  Program, Fall 2020  
 
Note that this version is condensed for brevity, whereas the full lesson plan provides instructors with detailed, step -by-step 
instructions for conducting each of the numbered elements. Note also that, due to the pandemic, all Cohort  sessions in 2020 were 
held virtually over Zoom.  
 
The theme of this session is “Asking questions  and exploring ideas: how NYU Libraries can support your research.” Co -led by the 
librarian, advisor, and college leader, its overall goal is to decrease anxiety about using the library and maintaining intel lectual 
honesty by increasing students’ knowledge  about library resources, inquiry, and academic integrity.  
 
Learning Objectives:  
• Continue to get to know people in your cohort  
• Become acquainted with the concept of research as inquiry  
• Familiarize yourself with library resources and ways to seek assistance  
• Grow more familiar and knowledgeable about academic integrity  
 
1. Class objectives  (led by librarian, 2 min.): The librarian introduces learning objectives and manages the slide 
presentation and screen sharing for the entire session.   
 
2. Connection activity  (advisor & college leader, 15 min.): To provide an opportunity to students to connect and prime 
them for the class themes of inquiry and authority, students are assigned to breakout rooms to discuss the question, “what 
are you an unofficial expert  in?” Students return to the large group for a share -out and a brief discussion about who might 
be considered an authority, depending on the context.  
 
3. Research introduction and activity  (librarian, 10 min.): Students are provided with a Mentimeter link, wh ere they are 
asked to share three words or phrases that answer the question “What comes to mind when you hear the word research ?” 
The librarian briefly comments on the word cloud resulting from the Mentimeter exercise and proceeds to introduce the 
concept of “research as inquiry” (asking questions and refining direction by asking new and/or increasing complex 
questions), followed by a discussion about the progression of research skills from high school through the undergraduate 
years.  
 
4. Activity for generati ng a research topic idea  (librarian, 15 min.):  Students are asked to reflect on an iconic photo from 
the 1968 Olympics of two athletes on the winners’ podium with their fists raised in the air. Students are asked to return to 
Mentimeter and respond to the  prompt: “What questions come to mind when you look at this image?” Students are 
encouraged to type in any and all questions that come up for them. The librarian comments on the questions populated in 
Mentimeter and asks if students have any questions or d iscussion points they would like to express verbally. The librarian 
sums up by saying that a compelling visual, such as the photo used in this exercise, can captivate our attention, cause us 
to wonder, and prompt us to ask questions that could lead in the direction of an interesting research topic.  
 
5. Library resources introduction  (librarian, 10 min.): The librarian segues into a brief, high -level introduction to starting 
research on a topic by providing an overview of library resources and services, includi ng: the purpose of the catalog and 
databases; the usefulness of Research Guides; how to get help via chat, email, and consultation; and where to find online 
tutorials and the schedule of library workshops and that can help improve research skills.  
 
6. Academi c integrity introduction and activity  (advisor and college leader, 20 min.): The advisor introduces a definition 
of academic integrity, then points students to a Mentimeter slide which asks the multiple choice  question “How does 
academic integrity make you feel?” Students chose one of five responses: confused, annoyed, scared, confident, or 
overwhelmed. The advisor comments on the tallied results. The college leader then points students to the next Mentimeter 
126        LOEX -2021    -DEMETER , MCCARTIN  AND BAILEY - slide which asks, “In which of the following situations do you think a student is more likely to cheat?” ranking the 
choices on a 4 -point scale of “most likely” to “less likely.” Choices include: being in a panic to complete an assignment; 
not wanting to pu t the required time and effort; lacking confidence about sharing a personal idea and assuming others’ 
ideas are better; and being unclear about how to cite properly. The college leader then comments on the tallied results and 
concludes the session with an overview of strategies and resources that can support a consistent practice of academic 
honesty.  
 
7. Student feedback  (librarian, 5 min.): The librarian provides students with a link to a form to provide feedback about the 
session.

TRANSFORMATIVE COLLABORATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES 
AND OUTREACH FOR INTERNATIONAL AND DIVERSE 
STUDENTS : A MULTIPLE CAMPUS PERSONAL LIBRARIAN 
PILOT CASE STUDY  
RACINE AMOS  AND EMILY REED 
ORIGIN OF THE PERSONAL LIBRARIAN PROGRAM  
During Spring 2020,  Penn State  University  transitioned to remote learning  due to COVID -19 to prioritize world health and 
safety. This resulted in quick innovation and deployment of a multitude of resources to support learning, instruction, and re search. 
Since libraries are a key resource for university communities, it became necessary to evolv e and expand the variety and delivery of 
services.  
Globally, Fall 2020 planning included a reduction in the number of students and researchers present on campuses and 
incorporation of a high er number of online classes. As part of this planning, t he concep t of a personal librarian initiative was 
developed by the library to collaborate with students , in order to attempt to mitigate any potential remote learning barriers and be 
reflective of the intersectional and unique needs of students in the completion of academic coursework, research , and loss of 
connection to their institution.  
The primary goals of the initiative were  to: 1) ensure students are aware of library resources, services and programs to 
support student academic success; 2 ) decrease  student anxiety in remote use of library resources and services; 3 ) establish a personal 
point of contact with students for engagement, support and connection in the new virtual learning environment.  
PILOT   
The personal librarian program  pilot was i ntenti onally  developed as an innovative approach recognizing  that the diversity 
of an individual student’s environment, experience , and needs can influence access and utilization of library resources. Th e pilot 
reflect ed the following two strategic goals of Penn State University Libraries, Library Learning Services: to cultivate informed 
scholars who are able to gather and evaluate in formation and use information resources meaningfully throughout their academic 
careers and beyond; to develop inclusive and welcoming Library environments with intention and authenticity in support of the 
whole student.  
Penn State University  Libraries  ethos is that we are  “one library geographically dispersed”  across  twent y-four campuses , 
spread  out over 46,000 sq. miles, so this initiative sought to foster engagement by University Libraries  to positively impact the 
academic success of distinctive populations of Penn State undergraduate students across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The 
targeted populations for the pilot were undergraduate students enrolled in Educational Equity Scholar Pro grams (access and 
development for minoritized students) and international undergraduate students.  
128        LOEX -2021   -AMOS AND REED- Undergraduate enrollment at Penn State University for Fall 2020 included 74,446 students , of which 6.92% identified as 
traditionally marginalized or from  international communities  (The Pennsylvania State University Data Digest, 2021) . This initiative 
recognized that these students  may be impacted by a diverse spectrum of learning and accessibility barriers. These factors are 
reflective of a spectrum of stud ent life experiences , historical and intersectional  challenges  that are  influenced by race, ethnicity, 
language , culture, religion, etc., along with  the stressful uncertainty of a global pandemic . The transition to remote learning in Spring 
2020 quickly brought “digital inequality” to the forefront for undergraduate college students  (Katz et al., 2021) .  A few examples: 
equipment or technical assistance necessary for remote learning ; internet connec tivity and/or resident country censorship concerns ; 
and limited access to services due to national and international time differences.   
As a pilot it was difficult to predict engagement and interest by the target populations. In a brief review of relevant literature, 
results of a 2015 -2016 academic year study at Santa Clara University's Personal Librarian Program for transfer students, 36.4 % of 
participants were “active” users (responded or met with Personal Librarian one time) and of those participants, 9 .6% were ""very 
active ,"" defined as “ interacted with their librarian at least twice ” (LaFrance & Kealey, 2017) . Based on scanning available literature, 
it was anticipated that each personal librarian should have capacity to participate , serving as an adjunct resource to the existing Ask -
A-Librarian (AAL) reference service.  
Proposal  
The pilot was developed to provide strictly email/virtual support (with or without video) by appointment based on student 
and personal librarian availability during the 2020 -2021 academic year.  Implementation of the personal librarian pilot included 
recruitment of librarians, construction of the pilot site wit hin the existing learning management system (LMS), marketing and 
recruitment of students, monthly perso nal librarian meetings , and assessment at conclusion of the pilot project.  
Recruiting Librarians  
Recruitment of librarians was limited to those already engaged in support of the identified target populations  with a 
willingness to raise awareness about lib rary resources and to support students and research . Many of these librarians were 
experienced in providing public reference services through the existing AAL  reference service and this serves an opportunity to 
provide personalized guidance to a static coh ort of self -identified students. Each librarian was able to self -define desired hours, the 
number of students and campus affiliation they desired to support.   All personal librarians committed to attend monthly virtual 
meetings to review current enrollment , strategize marketing efforts and develop announcements for the personal librarian home page. 
Additionally, a Microsoft Team was established for librarians to communicate and share resources.  
The Pilot Coordinator , Racine Amos,  served as the personal librarian for Educational Equity Scholar Programs with a 
projected maximum of 100 participants. In the event that participant interest exceed ed 75 participants, recruitment of additional 
personal librarians w ould be initiated.  Inte rnational students had six personal librarians with a projected maximum of 230 
participants with all librarians expressing willingness to assume additional students if needed.   The Pilot Coordinator arranged 
training for participating  librarians on use of the LibCal scheduling feature in LibApps by Springshare and an overview including  
navigation of the Canvas LMS.  LibCal also offered students the opportunity to complete an anonymous survey  (see Appendix A)  to 
provide feedback regarding their appointment  with their personal librarian.  
The geographic scope of the pilot spanned several campuses with one or more participating librarians.  In addition to three 
University Park librarians, librarians participated from Abington, Altoona, Berks, and Harrisburg campuses.  Twenty -five 
international  students self-enrolled  in the program, 18 of whom were based out of  Harrisburg. Harrisbu rg is a larger , less rural  
commonwealth campus , with over 600 international students enrolled in 2020 -2021 who currently make up about 12.5% of the 
student population.  Emily Reed  is a Penn State Harrisburg librarian  who is tasked with  coordinating library services, resources, and 
outreach  specifically  for international students on the campus  who volunteered to participate a s a personal librarian  working directly 
with international students  enrolled  at Harrisburg.  
Marketing  
The initial marketing plan for the pilot was sensitive to the participating personal librarians’  capacity concerns  and desires 
to support students who identified the mselves as attending the  librarian’s home campus ; it  did not include any university -wide 
marketing ef forts. Outreach was provided to the  Educational Equity Scholar and International Student Programs , with pilot 
information , templates for email and LMS announcements  for promotion of the pilot with their respective student populations . The 
templates include d information on the role and expectations for students engaging with a personal librarian  as well as information 
on how to enroll in the pilot.  Additionally, a short promotional video  with similar information was created and placed on  the home 
page of the  pilot site . During Fall 2020  and Spring 2021, the Canvas Pride received 288 page views from 26 unique students.  
-TRANSFORMATIVE COLLABORATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES…- LOEX -2021       129 At the campus level, Reed  took a localized marketing approach. At Harrisburg, Reed  reached out to campus partners such 
as the International Student Support Services (ISSS) unit, instructors of English Language Learners courses, and the Harrisburg 
Library’s Outreach Coordinator to promote the pilot. All international students at Harrisbu rg received an invitation to join via email 
from ISSS , the librarian was invited  to speak about  the program  at the beginning of  ISSS  events, it was promoted during class time 
by their professors or Reed  in English Language Learners courses , and it was prom oted through  Harrisburg Library’s  and ISSS’s  
social media channels.  More than half of  students who joined Harrisburg’s personal librarian  group joined after learning about the 
program from the librarian during class , with 6.5% of students reached deciding to join . A few also joined after learning about the 
program from an elevator pitch presented by the librarian  during ISSS events , for a success rate of 10% reached . Having a librarian 
invite students over Zoom was by far the most effective method of successfully recruiting students to join.  
Logistics   
The personal librarian  program architecture was designed within  the university’s learning management system, Canvas. A 
course was created that was publicly viewable, Personal Librarian for International Students . The course structure acts as a 
centralized online location for students to learn about the personal librarian  program  and the participating personal librarians . If a 
student wishe d to join the program, they would first l og in with their Penn State credentials, then self -enroll in the course. 
Additi onally, Canvas courses offer the capability of offering individualized groups within the course. This allows students to review 
and select which group , differentiated by librarian and campus, best fits their needs and interests. After students self-enrolle d in the 
overall course, they join ed one of the campus  group s. Students were able to schedule research appointments with their personal 
librarian by accessing LibCal from within Canvas. For each campus group, the personal librarian was able to post  group  
announcements, message students in the group using the Inbox tool, publish  group  pages , add events to the group calendar, and 
create  group  discussion forums.  
In the fall semester, Reed  created  pages that could serve  as ready reference resources for  students  (see Figure 1) . Individual 
pages included  information about the program, links to  campus and university  resources, and information about each subject librarian 
at Harrisburg.  
Figure 1 : Group Page , “Welcome to the Personal Librarian Program”  
 
 
Reed also attempted to engage students using the discussion forums  during the fall semester , but these were much less 
successful , so she didn’t continue with discussion forums in the spring. Some of the forums included  a Library Q&A, an introductions  
forum , and specialty topics such as banned books, library vocabulary, and international games. Only two students responded to the 
introductions forum, and none of the other  forum s received  any participation.  
Reed  primarily used announcements t o communicate with student s. Announcements consisted of textual and image content 
created using a rich content  editor (see Figure 2).  Two or three announcements were posted per week. Announcements focused on 
current events happening at Harrisburg Library, University Libraries, or other campus -specific events ; library resource  or service  
spotlights, opportunities for scholarships or contests , etc. Students receive d notifications about group announcements according to 
their set  Canvas  preferences , such as rec eiving an email or a push notification on their phone whenever an announcement was posted. 
Announcements about events and programs would often reference events  cross -posted to the group calendar.  

130        LOEX -2021   -AMOS AND REED- Figure 2 : Announcement, “ Penn State Harrisburg: Virtual Poster Fair with $75 Prizes ” 
 
 
Assessment  Plan   
Assessment objectives were to determine any increase in participant knowledge  or use, and decrease in anxiety resulting 
from  using university libraries resources; to identify themes related to  partic ipant information seeking and requests, to inform future 
outreach and/or program continuation; to assess the efficiency and efficacy of providing personal librarian services; to synt hesize 
student and personal librarian assessment and feedback of program.   It is intended to utilize quantitative and qualitative data that 
includes cohort enrollment, number of appointments scheduled/completed, and student and personal librarian feedback surveys at 
the conclusion of the pilot Spring 2021.   
Additionally, Reed  is keeping track of all interactions in Canvas  with Harrisburg students , such as communications from 
individual students via the Canvas Inbox, participation in discussion forums (for Fall 2020), and consultation requests. So far, three 
unique students have reached out to the librarian via the Canvas Inbox with questions, and one reference consultation  was scheduled. 
While these numbers aren’t high, they should be viewed in context paired with number of site views  and survey responses.  
SUCCESSES   
 While the pilot may not have  produced the  high numbers we initially hoped for, there have been quite a few benefits that 
have resulted. First, it brought together a team of librarians from several of Penn State’s campuses who have similar responsibiliti es 
working with international students.  The librarians  have co nnect ed, discuss ed ideas, and examined  challenges that each faced at their 
campuses. Secondly, it strengthened university and campus partnerships. Most importantly, even though our numbers weren ’t vast, 
the individual students who did participate were kept apprised of library updates, events, resources, services, and opportunities.   
LESSONS LEARNED  
It became evident that the personal librarian pilot had to adapt and be flexible to the need of stu dents. At one campus, rather 
than partici pate in the designed pilot, the librarian became “embedded” in the class at the request of the instructor. Although students 
were familiar with the Canvas LMS, the workflow for enrollment was cumbersome for students  to navigate. To enable easier access, 
a “landing page” with program information and librarian profiles will be developed with links for co mmunication and scheduling.  
Due to multiple roles of librarians , the need for appointment scheduling by email in addition to  LibCal eliminated some scheduling  
challenges for  participating librarians. Finally, it was demonstrated that mark eting strategies  must go beyond program level and be 
universal to provide greater awareness of the program to desired populations. The plan is  to centralize previous contacts and 
marketing efforts , to establish a toolkit  of marketing resources  for each librarian to utilize on individual campuses and to develop a 
press release with publi c relations and marketing for Fall 2021.  
NEXT STEPS   
 The personal librarians are currently discussing a one -year extension of the pilot. One challenge is that  visa requirements, 
the availability of consulates, and international travel will impact how many  of our international students are able to return to campus 
in the Fall 2021. Fortunately, the learning management system  is a platform that reaches all Penn State students regardless of location . 
Even if not all campuses continue to participate in the pil ot, Harrisburg will continue to offer the personal librarian  program in order 

-TRANSFORMATIVE COLLABORATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES…- LOEX -2021       131 to offer the significant  international student population an opportunity to better connect with the library.  Finally, we plan to market 
the program more broadly throughout the institution.

TRANSFORMING INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES FOR STUDENT 
ENGAGEMENT IN A HYFLEX INFORMATION LITERACY COURSE  
ZOEANNA MAYHOOK , ANNETTE BOCHENEK  AND HEATHER HOWARD 
INTRODUCTION  
 In response to the COVID -19 pandemic, Purdue University and schools across the country transitioned classes to a virtual 
environment in the Spring 2020 semester. After extensive planning, the decision was made to hold classes on campus for the Fa ll 
2020 se mester with options for students who were either unable to or preferred not to return to campus. Librarians in the Parrish 
Library of Management and Economics teach a two -credit hour course for high -achieving freshmen in the Krannert School of 
Management a nd Economics, Management 110: Introduction to Management and Information Strategies  (MGMT 110). For the Fall 
2020 semester, the instructors were challenged to redesign the course for HyFlex (Hybrid Flexible) delivery, with classes hel d once 
a week on campu s and additional asynchronous content provided online. To add to this challenge, a cohort of students were unable 
to be on campus, primarily due to international travel restrictions; therefore, the course had  to also be available in an entirely virtual 
format. Further, Purdue had recently migrated from the Blackboard learning manage ment system (LMS) to the BrightS pace LMS 
during Summer 2020, making this the first semester that both students and instructors used this new platform.  
COURSE BACKGROUND  
 MGMT 11 0 teaches information literacy skills in an introductory business context. The course is required for high -achieving 
students in the Larsen Leaders Academy, a learning community for students with a minimum GPA of 3.7 and a 28 ACT or 1320 
SAT score who are directly admitted to the Krannert School of Management and Economics (Purdue University, 2021). Previous 
iterations of MGMT  110 relied on active and experiential learning to allow students to practice making evidence -based decisions 
(Stonebraker & Howard, 2018). This  exclusively in -person version of the course met twice a week : once as a large lecture and again 
in smaller lab sections that met in an active -learning computer lab. During the smaller lab sections, the students would work together 
in teams to s olve case challenges related to the different areas of management that required them to gather information and use that 
information to make evidence -based decisions. The course content that focused on teaching students how to find information was 
presented  in a flipped classroom, where class time was spent applying lecture concepts to real -world business challenges.  
The course culminate d in a case competition sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company. The students use d the information -
gathering and decision -making skills they ha d learned throughout the semester to complete a case wherein they compare d two 
pharmaceutical assets and advise d Eli Li lly judges about which they should acquire. Representatives from Eli Lilly visit ed the class 
to discuss the company and the case. The student teams were given a week to research the case, determine a solution, and assemble 
a presentation. Eli Lilly sends a pproximately ten judges to campus, while faculty from the Krannert School of Business and 
Economics and the Libraries and School of Information Studies also participate d as judges. All teams present ed to rooms of three 
judges in the morning, and finalists are invited back to present to a panel of Eli Lilly judges in the afternoon. The finalists are also 
invited to have lunch with the judges, giving them an excellent opportunity to network and build relationships that could lea d to 
future internships. The La rsen Leaders Academy Executive Board is composed of students who have take n the course in previous 
years and who arrange d the logistics for the competition , such as room reservations and lunch for the judges and finalists. The 
students were graded on their  participation and a written reflection, and the event serve d as a low -stakes introduction to case 
competitions.   
142        LOEX -2021   -MAYHOOK , BOCHENEK  AND  HOWARD - TRANSFORMATION TO HYFLEX 
IMPACT X+  
During the summer of 2020, instructors restructured their MGMT 110 course using an online asynchronous fac ulty 
development program called IMPACT X+ ( Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Transformation ), which was offered through 
Purdue University. The goal of the program was to guide instructors through fundamental principles of course design and encou rage 
the implementation of resilient, engaging, equitable, and student -centered HyFlex courses (Maybee et. al., 2013).  
With the transition to online instruction in Spring 2020, many students felt disconnected and struggled with motivation. To 
address this growing  challenge, IMPACT X+ modules were framed through  the lens of Self -Determination Theory (SDT), a 
motivational framework that supports autonomous externalized and internalized motivation by creating positive learning 
environments that fulfill a student’s ba sic psychological needs. SDT presents motivation on a spectrum that begins with 
“amotivation” (i.e., a lack of intentionality ) and moves towards “controlled extrinsic motivation, ” such as seeking praise and avoiding 
shame. Next are forms of “autonomous extrinsic motivation, ” including the understanding or feeling that course tasks can be used 
to promote personal goals. Finally, “intrinsically motivated ” students find satisfaction o r enjoyment from engagement in their 
courses.  
While pure intrinsic motivation can be difficult to achieve with all students, instructors are encouraged to design their 
courses and activities to meet student needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.  Autonomy refers specifically to providing 
choices for how students approach their coursework. Competence is the need to feel capable of successfully completing desired  tasks 
or outcomes. Finally, relatedness is the desire to build meaningful relationships  and connections with others.  
Using SDT and other resources provided by the IMPACT X+ program, MGMT 110 learning outcomes and objectives, 
activities, and a course map were modified to support the new HyFlex format:  
Learning outcomes : In prior iterations of the course, team management and quick evidence -based decision -making were 
significant learning objectives, especially when completing in -class group case challenges. Due to the HyFlex environment and 
COVID -related precautions, group work was moved to a virtual setting. To reflect this change, learning objectives were adapted to 
include effective virtual team management, which is also a relevant skill set in modern business environments. Because MGMT 1 10 
is an introductory business course, instructors aim ed to provide a structure for students to autonomously choose and explore 
professional development opportunities and career interests. As a result, learning objectives and assessment methods were add ed to 
reinforce this goal.   
Reworking activities : Multip le strategies and considerations were used when adapting activities and assignments. First, 
instructors moved all course deliverables online within the Bright Space LMS, such as quizzes, discussion boards, surveys, and 
assignment pages. For more complex ass ignments, like the final case competition, additional tools and platforms were used. Next, 
assignments were rewritten using the IMPACT X+ assignment template, which outlined assignment goals, and stated how these 
goals connected to student competence and r elatedness.  
Course mapping : Using a template from the IMPACT X+ program, instructors applied MGMT 110’s instructional design 
to a course map that connected learning objectives to their methods of assessment ( e.g., activities and assignments). Additionally , 
the template prompted instructors to consider SDT in their approaches, such as opportunities for choice in topics and team ro les and 
offering virtual spaces for students to relate and connect with peers through informal discussion threads and chat groups . 
Online Cohort  
 The instructors also redesigned the course to accommodate the cohort of distance learners, many of whom were based 
internationally, as well as students who were unable to attend class due to either a positive COVID -19 test or possible exp osure. 
Each in -person lecture was recorded using software that captured audio from the classroom microphones and content projected from 
the classroom computer, and the recording  was saved  on the U niversity’s instance  of Kaltura MediaSpace. Once the video w as 
available, the instructors ran a program that generated captions, and then  manually edited the captions for accuracy. The lectures 
were then made available in the course LMS for all students.  
Students were put into groups at the beginning of the semeste r and they continued to work with the same group on all of 
their projects. The instructors decided early on that they would not isolate the online cohort into their own groups, but rat her, would 
mix them in with the students on campus, giving them a chance  to get to know additional students. This also provided opportunities 
for groups to practice managing virtual teams with members working across international time zones.  
 
-TRANSFORMING INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES FOR STUDENT ENGAGEMENT …- LOEX -2021       143 Case Competition  
 To transition the case competition to a HyFlex format, instructors  incorporated  virtual tools to manage  the different teams  
online. Similar to previous years, the Larsen Leaders Academy Executive Board arranged the logistics, but they now used Purdue’s 
Pitch p latform , a case management tool that assists with coordinating  participants, judges, and instructors , in addition to managing 
case information, student presentation videos , and judge feedback . A representative  from Eli Lilly also visited the course live via 
Zoom to introduce the case and answer questions. For the first round, students prepared pre -recorded video presentations t hat were 
uploaded to Pitch and viewed by multiple judges from Eli Lilly, who provided  feedback for each presentation. Following the first 
round, Eli Lilly Judges offered the opportunity for students to attend a live question and feedback session. For the final ro und, six 
finalists were selected to present live on Zoom, and three winning te ams were chosen and awarded certificate s.  
Learning Communities  
College learning communities are considered to be beneficial to the educational experience. Significant benefits of offering 
learning community experiences include enhanced student engagement  as well as retention (Kern & Kingsbury, 2019; Piercey & 
Cullen, 2017). By encouraging active learning and emphasizing collaboration, participation in learning communities leads stud ents 
to engage with one another more frequently, while contributing symbio tically to their learning community environment.  
Although learning communities typically interact through in -person courses, gatherings, and events, the global COVID -19 
pandemic complicated the in -person experience. To address this challenge, instructors o f MGMT 110 provided both formal and 
informal virtual spaces and activities for students to build relationships with each other, as well as opportunities to conne ct with their 
instructors, guest speakers, and alumni. This included informal chatting in Micro soft Teams, discussion spaces in BrightSpace, 
virtual “coffee talks” with instructors, Q&As with guest speakers over Zoom, and an “interview an alumnus” assignment.  
Participation  
Because the cohort of online and on -campus students was unable to attend in -person sessions, much consideration went 
into devising equitable means of participation. Most participation took place online thr ough weekly posts within BrightS pace 
discussion boards. However, some in -person sessions also included synchronous classroom ac tivities to develop an active learning 
environment. Under these circumstances, alternatives to class activities were provided online.  
OUTCOMES  
Failures  
Throughout the MGMT 110 course, the instructors were met with various challenges and successes, which w ould inform 
future approaches to the course in its HyFlex format. Among the key challenges in the course were obstacles regarding the use  of 
Microsoft Teams, the physical layout of the classroom, and the struggle to buil d relationships with students. To al low students in the 
Larsen Leaders Academy an opportunity to engage with one another informally, Microsoft Teams was provided as an alternative 
virtual space for questions and dialogue. Unfortunately, student use of Microsoft Teams was low and instead other methods of 
communication were preferred. The instructors also found out later that the students were being asked to use multiple platforms for 
their other courses and were overwhelmed. Additionally, the physical classroom space posed its own array of cha llenges. Students 
attended class socially distanced in a large room, seated at tables that did not directly face the front of the room. Given t he table 
positioning, the location of students seated at the front and back of the room , and the required use of masks that hid facial expressions 
and muffled voices, students were less inclined to participate in person, which also made it difficult for instructors to get  to know 
their students. To offer a more organic approach to interacting with students, the instr uctors held virtual “coffee talks” via Zoom. 
These Zoom sessions were optional and not well attended, though the students who did show up seemed to enjoy the chance to 
connect with their professors. Group and interpersonal activities in the classroom were also limited and had to be reimagined due to 
safety precautions, limiting chances for interaction with students in the in -person setting. Though virtual opportunities to build 
relationships were extended in the form of discussion boards, virtual coffee tal ks, and office hours, none were quite as beneficial  as 
in-person opportunities would have been.  
Successes  
Despite the challenges posed during the MGMT 110 course, there were several notable successes, including the transition 
to a team -teaching approach, the various new opportunities for student -engagement in the HyFlex format, and the incorporation of 
guest s peakers to supplement course materials. Rather than the course being delivered by a sole instructor, the course benefited fro m 
the collaboration of three instructors with various business perspectives, backgrounds, and teaching styles. In addition, act ivities for 
engagement encompassed a wide variety of learning modalities, including case challenges, group work, in -class work, and the 
144        LOEX -2021   -MAYHOOK , BOCHENEK  AND  HOWARD - opportunity to interview an alumnus. In particular, the case challenge s had students approach problem solving from a manager ial 
mindset using realistic business scenarios, and allowing students to work effectively in groups inside and outside the classroom. In -
class work often leaned towards formative assessment, giving students time to interact with the content individually, a s well as within 
socially distant pairs or groups. The “interview an alumnus” assignment gave students the chance to engage with Purdue alumni  
beyond the confines of the classroom, allowing them to network remotely with an individual who was actively worki ng in a certain 
facet of business. The incorporation of a broad range of guest speakers also served to enhance the course by offering student s the 
opportunity to engage with individuals who represented an area of business covered in class. Among the variou s internal and external 
organization guest speakers were employees from Eli Lilly, who judged the case competition and shared their work experiences with 
students, as well as internal faculty and staff highlighting opportunities for international study and  the importance of international 
business. Moreover, the MGMT 110 course concluded with a Zoom presentation from a high -profile alumnus who highlighted career 
experiences and helped guide students through a self -SWOT analysis. The Zoom platform allowed onl ine students to watch his 
presentation live and ask questions via chat. The use of in -person and remote speakers proved to be a successful way to reinforce 
course content and will be retained as an effective teaching strategy.  
CONCLUSION  
Overall, the MGMT  110 course and its learning community setting offer a rich overview of information strategies and 
business career opportunities for students aspiring to take on managerial roles. Transformed from an in -person experience to the 
HyFlex classroom model, the course reimagined assignments and introduced new activities to enhance the learning experience in a 
combination of remote and in -person methods. Though many challenges were encountered during the progression of the course, 
successes were also evident. An e xamination of course challenges and successes will help the instructors to revisit course content 
and teaching strategies as reflective practitioners aiming to provide a meaningful and engaging learning experience for their  students 
during the pandemic and  beyond.

 TRANSFORMING INSTRUCTION LEADERSHIP : WHAT 2020  
TAUGHT US ABOUT SUPPORTING THE WHOLE INSTRUCTION  
LIBRARIAN   
SARAH NORRELL  
INTRODUCTION  
 2020 was one of the most challenging and traumatic years in recent history. Spanning across countless generations, the 
events that unfolded during those twelve months —as well as their repercussions —will not be soon forgotten. Libraries did not escape 
the effects of the year, and academic librarie s experienced their ramifications firsthand. Due to the vast adjustments within higher 
education throughout and following 2020, it posits that library leadership and expectations —especially those of instruction and 
information literacy —are in need of a tra nsformation. Only by supporting the whole instruction librarian through the trauma -
informed care model will this transformation succeed and last.  
LIBRARY INSTRUCTION LEADERSHIP  
 Due to the varying nature of information literacy instruction across higher education, institutions, and libraries, the 
information literacy leadership role is difficult to define. Some leaders may hold the title of “Director” or “Head” of instr uction; 
these titles are often accompanied by supervisory, authority, or managem ent responsibilities. Alternatively, other leaders may hold 
titles such as “Coordinator” or “Lead Librarian” for instruction, usually lacking the authority or supervisory responsibiliti es but still 
holding distinction. Regardless of the leader’s title, the  role retains the same general expectations. According to Clara S. Fowler and 
Scott Walter, the instructional leader “is now committed to systematic planning for an instructional program that must be eff ectively 
articulated across the academic program and coordinated with the efforts of complementary instructional initiatives originating from 
outside the library” (2003, p. 466), all while utilizing inherent skills consistent with management personnel.  
 The American Library Association provides countless res ources and publications for creating, maintaining, and supporting 
an instruction program within academic libraries. Two such publications, “Guidelines for Instruction Programs in Academic 
Libraries” (2011) and “Characteristics of Programs of Information Li teracy that Illustrate Best Practices: A Guideline” (2019), 
provide distinct goals, structure, and components of effective instruction programs. For any professional involved in informa tion 
literacy instruction, such publications and resources are invaluab le. However, what these publications lack is clear direction for the 
leaders of such programs. The publication “Standards for Proficiencies for Instruction Librarians and Coordinators: A Practic al 
Guide” (American Library Association, 2008) fills this gap.  Since its publication in 2008, the state of information literacy instruction 
has changed tremendously, necessitating a  revision and update of such a guide (American Library Association, 2021). Additionally, 
while this publication directly addresses twelve  separate proficiencies for instruction librarians and coordinators, it does not provide 
recommendations for developing these skills, much less how to support fellow instruction librarians through stressful or trau matic 
times —such as those experienced thro ughout 2020.  
 
 
134        LOEX -2021   -NORRELL - STRESS AND TRAUMA FROM 2020  
 The months of 2020 ransacked the planet as well as the health and well -being of its inhabitants. The global COVID -19 
pandemic impacted the economies, politics, and wealth of nations. As positive cases and the dea th count increased, governments 
implemented lockdowns, panic ensued, and masks as well as social -distancing measures became commonplace. The murder of 
George Floyd by police sparked global protests and a reinvigorated support for the Black Lives Matter mov ement (Sternlicht, 2020). 
Climate change intensified wildfires across the planet and caused record -breaking Antarctic temperatures (Leonard & Freedman, 
2020; Taylor, 2020). In the United States, the deaths of civil rights activist Representative John Lewis  and Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg rocked generations (Seelye 2020; Liptak, 2020). Harvey Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to prison 
(Dwyer, 2020), a landmark in #MeToo movement. The presidential election rocked the world, with a historic win for President Joe 
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and unprecedented distrust in the election process (Balz, 2020).  
 With so much chaos, combined with constant change due to the pandemic, individuals consistently suffered from high 
levels of chro nic stress which only progressed throughout the year. This chronic stress —along with the pressures of work and home 
life—manifested as trauma, often causing changes in their work ability. According to the Trauma and Justice Strategic Initiative 
Workgroup o f the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA):  
Individual trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as 
physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and t hat has lasting adverse effects on the individual’s functioning and 
mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well -being. (2014, p. 7)  
Instruction librarians were not immune from this trauma and its effects. Since there has been very little change in global 
circumstances, influences on stress, or information literacy instruction expectations, it is time to change how instructional  leaders 
serve instruction librarians and progress their information literacy programs.  
POST-2020  APPROACHES TO INSTRUCTI ON LEADERSHIP  
Trauma -Informed Care  
Well established within the health care setting, trauma -informed care is an approach that recognizes how past trauma affects 
a person (Anonymous, 2018). While this past trauma can be unique to an individual or shared by a  group, it can present in a multitude 
of ways. Due to the high number of public traumatic events throughout 2020, manifestations of these shared experiences most l ikely 
affect each librarian differently. Therefore, to serve and lead instruction librarians equitably, leaders should seek to recognize these 
manifestations and understand them among their fellow librarians.  
According to trauma -informed care, this recognition and understanding is often accomplished by focusing on “the three 
E’s”: Events, Experien ces, and Effects (Trauma and Justice Strategic Initiative Workgroup, 2014). To understand how trauma is 
affecting an individual, the traumatic Events must be identified. The trauma manifestations rely upon an individual’s past 
Experiences, and thus directl y informs the Effects of the trauma on the individual. Within academic libraries, this could take the 
shape of burnout, illness, absenteeism, passive aggression, loss of interest or passion, and more. In worse case scenarios, t hese trauma 
responses could l ead to or further develop a dysfunctional or toxic workplace (Henry et al., 2018).  
 Recognition and understanding may be the first step according to trauma -informed care, but it should not be the only step 
leaders take to support their instruction librarians. It is equally important to resist any form of re -traumatization by creating and 
maintaining a trauma -informed workplace. These steps constitute parts of “the four R’s”: Realizing the impact of trauma, 
Recognizing the signs of trauma, Responding by creating a trauma -informed organization, and Resisting re -traumatization (Trauma 
and Jus tice Strategic Initiative Workgroup, 2014). According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a 
trauma -informed organization or workplace adheres to the following: provides a safe environment, ensures transparency and trust, 
provi des peer support, supports collaboration, empowers individuals by supporting their voice and choices, and maintains a 
“sensitivity to cultural, historical, and gender issues” (Anonymous, 2018, p. 5; Trauma and Justice Strategic Initiative Work group, 
2014).  In 2016, Christopher Menschner and Alexandra Maul outlined a number of ways to provide a safe environment for staff, 
separating recommendations into categories addressing the physical workplace and the social -emotional one (pp. 4 -5). Options such 
as “main taining communication that is consistent, open, respectful, and compassionate ,” “keeping consistent schedules and 
procedures ,” and “offering sufficient notices and preparation when changes are necessary” (Menschner & Maul, 2016, p. 5) are of 
potential inte rest to individuals leading instruction librarians.  
Whole Person Support  
 Whole person support is known by many names, such as “whole person care”, “whole employee support”, or “ whole -
employee care .” While utilized or referenced in a number of fields and industries, it originated within the nursing and health science 
-TRANSFORMING INSTRUCTION LEADERSHIP : WHAT 2020  TAUGHT US…- LOEX -2021       135 fields as a model for patient care and employee support. Often, the model is established within an organization without being  
explicitl y stated or defined. The main component of whole person support or care is acknowledging that people are multi -faceted 
individuals, rather than just the sum of their work or productivity.  
 In order to acknowledge the many facets or dimensions of an individ ual, a leader must first work to recognize the inputs —
and not just the outputs —of their employee. Marty Martin describes these inputs as “drivers” and “drainers” in the life of an employee 
(2013, p. 10). These inputs could take the shape of children, spous es or partners, elderly parents, emotional, mental or physical health 
concerns, finances, and more. Any number of factors may drive or drain an employee and their work performance. The whole pers on 
support model acknowledges these inputs and paves the way for an environment of care for the whole employee.  
 According to Lucia Thornton, this model “helps us move beyond our cultural, religious, social, and economic differences 
and helps us perceive the inherent unity of life” (2013, p. 40). Without this focus on unity, the workplace lacks a sense of belonging —
therefore decreasing job satisfaction. As leaders connect with individuals about their inputs, the workplace culture shifts f rom one 
focusing on productivity and output to one supporting employees as whole  people. “[I]nteractions, work, and relationships begin to 
arise from a place of deep regard and reverence” (Thornton, 2013, p. 40). Only by utilizing the whole person support model ca n 
leaders truly boost collaboration, high performance, and the sense of true teamwork within the workplace.  
Emotional Intelligence  
The role of emotions in leadership cannot be overstated. “Emotional intelligence is what allows us to know and understand 
ourselves, control our actions, plan for the future, adapt to change, manag e conflict, relate to and understand others, and build deep, 
meaningful relationships” (Martin, 2019, p. 1). There are several components of emotional intelligence (EI), which together f orm a 
solid foundation for the whole person support model discussed ab ove, as well as leadership in general. Early definitions of EI list 
five components: self -awareness, managing emotions, motivating others, showing empathy, and staying connected (Goleman, 1998). 
Since this original definition, the five components have sinc e transformed into four leadership competencies: self -awareness, self -
management, social awareness, and relationship management (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2002a). Regardless of the definition 
to which a leader prescribes, emotional intelligence cannot be  ignored.  
 
 Not surprisingly, as a leader works to increase their level of emotional intelligence, their employees sense the change and 
follow suit. More importantly, as individuals work to increase their EI skills, the level of emotional intelligence of t he team 
simultaneously increases (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2002b). This naturally supports a workplace culture committed to 
supporting employees as whole people, however, this change must begin with the leader. Contrary to popular assumptions, EI is  not 
an alternative or competing skillset to cognitive ability or trade skills (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2002a). All are import ant, and 
in many cases necessary, for workplace success —although EI consistently improves profit and job satisfaction substantiall y more 
than cognitive or trade skills (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2002a). Daniel Goleman, in collaboration with Richard Boyatzis, A nnie 
McKee, and several others, has produced a vast collection of literature on the importance of emotional intelligence in leadership and 
teams (see Appendices A and B).  
LOOKING AHEAD  
 2020 left nothing untouched —from shopping to politics. It is no surprise that higher education and libraries required 
moderation to ensure success. Since there is no guarantee that procedures w ill ever return to “normal”, it only makes sense that 
library instruction and information literacy education should permanently change with the times and environment. By adopting the 
trauma -informed care model, embracing whole person support, and boosting emotional intelligence, library instruction leaders will 
remain relevant and engaging among their followers. These models go beyond the consistent push for work -life balance by embracing 
the individuality of employees, acknowledging the traumatic experienc es prevalent throughout 2020, and connecting with employees 
on a more personal and emotional level. As the world is recovering from one of the most challenging years in recent history, library 
leadership can boost employee engagement and job satisfaction b y welcoming and building off these models, inciting systemic 
change throughout the field.

TRANSFORMING PRIVACY LITERACY INSTRUCTION : FROM 
SURVEILLANCE THEORY TO TEACHING PRACTICE  
SARAH HARTMAN -CAVERLY AND ALEXANDRIA CHISHOLM  
INTRODUCTION : “PRIVACY LITERACY AND ITS PROBLEMS ” 
 Privacy is a core professional value of library practice. Revelations of state and corporate surveillance, social manipulatio n, 
and algorithmic injustice have renewed librarians’ interest in privacy instruction ( Bulger & Davidson 2018 ; Harper & Oltmann, 
2017 ; Lamdan, 2019; Leung, Baildon, & Albaugh, 2019 ; Sander, 2020 ). The ACRL Framework (2016) articulates privacy -related 
knowledge practices, and the ALA’s  Library Bill of Rights (2019) was recently amended to call on libraries to “advocate for, educate 
about, and protect people’s privacy.”  
Existing models of privacy literacy instruction often focus on frontend privacy settings, data protection, reputation 
management, and harm reduc tion ( Bawden & Robinson, 2020; Feerrar, 2020; Fortier & Burkell, 2015; Library Freedom, n.d.; 
Macrina, 2015 ; Walker, Ferguson, Rowell, Shorish, Bettinger,  & Patterson, 2020; Wittek, 2020;  Wissinger, 2017 ). These important, 
well-intentioned efforts may inadvertently leave participants more vulnerable despite their increased privacy knowledge. Empirical 
evidence of a privacy contro l paradox, whereby users with greater perceived control over their informational privacy often end up 
disclosing more than tho se with less perceived control, reveals a need to situate privacy literacy efforts in broader contexts of 
institutionalized privacy harms (Brandimarte, Acquisti, & Loewenstein, 2013).  
Hagendorff (2018) outlines four deficiencies in his critique of privacy literacy. First, considering privacy literacy as a form 
of social capital reveals that existing social inequities result in unequal access to privacy -related learning opportunities. Hagendorff 
notes that d ifferences in privacy knowledge are observed along lines of education, income, age, race and ethnicity, and gender 
identity. Such privacy literacy disparities can perpetuate social inequalities through the disparate impacts that institution alized 
surveillance imposes on members of vulnerable and marginaliz ed communities (Barocos & Selbst, 2016). Second, Hagendorff  
questions the premise that users are rational actors with respect to privacy and disclosure, given the realities of persuasiv e design, 
digital resignation, algorithmic manipulation, and the persi stent myth of the privacy paradox (Kokolakis, 2017; Solove, 2021). Third, 
Hagendorff critiques the frontend focus of privacy literacy, which contributes to technosolutionism and the control paradox. Finally, 
Hagendorff observes that user -centric privacy li teracy perpetuates responsibilization —a shift of responsibility for privacy 
governance to the disempowered user, and away from states and corporations. Hagendorff concludes:  
[P]rivacy literacy has to be more than just ticking boxes in the privacy settings.  Privacy literacy should comprise the ability 
to consider involuntary information disclosures by other individuals, to be aware of hidden data collections in devices of 
the Internet of Things, to know about missing privacy by default settings, and so on. ( 2018, p. 140)  
Informed by Hagendorff’s (2018) critique, Hartman -Caverly and Chisholm offer an alternative model for library -led 
privacy literacy programming. Their theory -informed approach defines privacy literacy as “a suite of knowledge, behaviors, and 
critical dispositions regarding the information constructs of selfhood, social relationships, and expressive activities” (Hart man-
Caverly & Chisholm, 2020, p. 306). The resulting learning experiences are predicated on a positive case for privacy as respec t for 
persons, not just protection for data. The positive case for privacy is depicted in their Six Private I’s conceptual framewor k as seen 
in Figure 1, which illustrates privacy as zones of protection for one’s identity, intellect, bodily and contextual in tegrity, intimate 
relationships, freedom of association (interaction) and ability to withdraw into voluntary solitude (isolation) (Hartman -Caverly & 
146        LOEX -2021   -HARTMAN -CAVERL Y AND CHISHOLM - Chisholm, 2020, p. 307). Navigated from the inner core of identity to the outermost sphere of social intera ction, these zones of 
protection are encapsulated by increasingly permeable information boundaries (Cohen, 2019). Privacy literacy supports the 
individual’s awareness of, ability to negotiate, and will to advocate for these boundaries by understanding priv acy as a value system 
rather than a technology (Hartman -Caverly & Chisholm, 2020). The remainder of this paper further explores critical surveillance 
theories, and related learning activities that enable participants to integrate these theories in the deve lopment of privacy literacy.

“CALCULATED GAZES”: ALGORITHMIC INJUSTICE IN THE DATA PANOPTICON  
 Foucault is broadly cited as the progenitor of critical surveillance theo ry, and despite renewed allegations about his sexual 
exploitation of children in Tunisia in the 1960s (Campbell, 2021), it is difficult to discuss the ubiquitous surveillance arc hitecture of 
today without acknowledging his groundbreaking contributions to i ts critique. Discipline and Punish  presents a historical analysis 
of the transmutation of power from a public spectacle to an internalized and participatory network of “calculated gazes,” coe rcing 
all members of society in mutual acts of surveillance and s ocial control (Foucault, 1995, p. 177). Foucault recognized Bentham’s 
architectural model for the Panopticon as an effective, efficient, generalizable, and transferable technology for social cont rol, capable 
of infusing society with an immaterial structure  of surveillance architecture (Foucault, 1995).  
The panoptic sort represents an early application of Foucauldian surveillance theory to analyze the exploitation of personal 
data in the information era. Gandy (1993) described the panoptic sort as a “discrim inatory technology” involved in the identification, 
classification, assessment, prediction, and manipulation of human behavior (p. 15). Furthermore, this “totalizing system of s ocial 
control” creates and perpetuates existing social inequities as it “determ ines the extent to which individuals will be included or 
excluded from the flow of information about their environment” (Gandy, 1993, pp. 1, 89). Barocas and Selbst (2016) further 
demonstrate the disparate impacts of these information asymmetries in their analysis of “digital redlining” (p. 692), which Benjamin 
(2019) calls “the New Jim Code” (p. 5). She warns that “automated systems… come to make decisions about people’s deservedness  
for all kinds of opportunities” (Benjamin, 2019, p. 10), perpetuating ine qualities in a manner that Noble terms “algorithmic 
oppression” (2019, p. 4).  
Privacy literacy learning experiences can support participants in seeing these otherwise invisible “calculated gazes,” 
viewing their own data doubles through a critical lens, and  considering their positionality in the panoptic sort. One highly 
personalized active learning tool is How Normal Am I?, an interactive documentary by Tijmen Schep, which offers an engaging 
introduction to artificial intelligence, biometrics, and implicati ons of modeled data (2020). The user is taken through a series of 
assessments using a real -time face recognition scan, including predictions for age, gender, beauty score, body mass index, life 
expectancy, and distractability based on behavioral data. Whil e users receive their various 'scores', Schep contextualizes how this 
data is measured and how it can be used, or in many cases, misused to make predictions about individuals that can have seriou s 
implications on future life opportunities.   Schep also high lights several inherent biases to facial recognition technologies, including 
their propensity to misidentify  people of color  (Simonite, 2019) . An alternate activity that is both less -intrusive and less time -

-TRANSFORMING PRIVACY LITERACY INSTRUCTION : FROM SURVEILLANCE …- LOEX -2021       147 intensive is to ask students to review and respon d to Schep’s longform infographic, Mathwashing (n.d.). Such learning opportunities 
can reveal the extent to which users are captive to the pervasive surveillance architecture —and leave them considering the possibility 
for escape.   
“NETWORK OF COERCION ”: SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM AND DIGITAL RESIGNATION  
 A common critique of privacy work is that privacy is dead, and people no longer care about privacy based on their behavior 
(Drum, 2013; Marketplace Tech, 2021 ; Mims, 2018; Popkin, 2010; Sahota, 2020; Sprenger, 1999 ). While privacy values and 
behaviors are dynamic and culturally bound, evidence suggests that “privacy is pluralistic - universally recognized and contextually 
realized” (Hartman -Caverly & Chisholm, 2020, p. 307). The presumpti on that people no longer care about privacy is borne of the 
privacy paradox —the observation that people’s actual privacy behaviors do not reflect their stated privacy values (Kokolakis, 2017). 
Recent public polling data challenges the claim that people no longer care about privacy (Auxier, Rainie, Anderson, Perrin, Kumar, 
& Turner, 2019; Perrin, 2020), and Solove recently declared the privacy paradox a myth arising from the logical fallacy of eq uating 
general privacy values with privacy behaviors in a speci fic context (2021).  
The disjuncture between privacy values and behaviors reveals the intentionally clandestine dynamics of the personal data 
trade. Zuboff warns that technology -mediated social infrastructures are undergirded by surveillance architecture, d esigned to capture 
not only data, but the very activities of everyday life. Surveillance capitalism is an emergent mode of profiteering through the 
reduction of uncertainty by monitoring and manipulating individuals’ behavior (2019). The prediction imperat ive of surveillance 
capitalism creates a complementary extraction imperative —the necessity to intrude into ever more human activities in order to 
capture data at scale and at scope (both breadth and depth), and to leverage the resulting information asymmet ries in order to control 
human behavior through actuation (Zuboff, 2019).  
Further research demonstrates the futility of even the most privacy literate consumer effectively controlling their personal 
data. Due to extensive data flows between third party ser vice providers, Noto la Diega and Wharton reasoned that a Google Nest 
user would need to review approximately one thousand privacy and terms of service agreements in order to make informed data 
management choices (2016). Another empirical critique of the “ notice and choice” privacy paradigm discovered that 74% of study 
participants bypassed the privacy policy by consenting to a clickwrap license agreement; famously, 93% of participants agreed  to 
‘gotcha’ terms of service that entailed signing over one’s fir st-born child to a fictitious social media company (Obar & Oeldorf -
Hirsch, 2020). Furthermore, research by Brandimarte, Acquisti  and Loewenstein concludes that “‘more’ control can sometimes lead 
to ‘less’ privacy” (2013, p. 345), a phenomenon known as the control paradox.  
The information asymmetries and labyrinthine data flows of surveillance capitalism provide no avenue for escape. 
Explicating what Zuboff calls a “network of coercion” (p. 238) Veronica Barassi observes that ""...surveillance capitalism dep ends 
on the systematic coercion of digital participation , which forces people to give up their personal data to comply with data 
technologies"" (2020, p. 34 , emphasis in original ). Surveillance architecture dispossesses users of their data, choice, and auton omy 
by design, such that in Zuboff’s stark words, “privacy policies do not matter” (2019, p. 250). As technology increasingly med iates 
access to human necessities, individuals are left with few meaningful privacy -preserving options, frequently yielding to digital 
resignation.  
Robust privacy literacy instruction should unveil the backend processes of personal data collection and manipulation, and 
subject them to critical examination —to the limited extent that this is possible. For example, t he authors’ own o riginal privacy 
workshop includes a metacognitive activity which enables participants to visit a series of interactive websites (i.e. , ClickClickClick , 
What Every  Browser Knows About You, and ad profiles from a variety of social media platforms) and indepe ndently explore 
behavioral surplus data tracking and personal advertisement profiling in real time (Chisholm & Harman -Caverly, 2021b; Moniker, 
n.d.; Linus, n.d.).   Students are then asked to reflect on the experience and anonymously respond to the prompt: ""What surprised you 
about the data that browsers track?   Are your ad profiles creepily accurate, or bizarrely inaccurate?"" This culminates in a large group 
discussion, allowing students to volunteer thoughts and instructors to contextualize the experience and answer questions. By giving 
stude nts hands -on exploration of behavioral data tracking, they are better able to visualize the extent of surveillance of their online 
activities and can form their own opinions about these practices and their implications.  These learning activities inspire participants 
to consider the degree to which their choices, behaviors, and very consciousness are subject to manipulation by surveillance 
capitalists.  
“AN ASSAULT ON AWARENESS ”: ATTENTION ENGINEERING  
Attention is consider ed a pathway to consciousness, a technique for acquiring knowledge, and a prerequisite to purposeful 
action (Mole, 2017); thus, it is hardly hyperbolic for Zuboff to assert that “every threat to human autonomy begins with an a ssault 
on awareness” (2019, p.  307). The system design factors impacting conscious awareness include attention engineering achieved 
through persuasive design, in which the user experience is engineered to manipulate people’s behaviors and influence their at titudes 
148        LOEX -2021   -HARTMAN -CAVERL Y AND CHISHOLM - (Fogg, 2003; Vanden A beele, 2020; Zuboff, 2019). Informed by Skinnerian behaviorism, persuasive design leverages “captivation 
metrics” —findings from activity logs interpreted through a psychological lens —to capture user attention and sustain user 
engagement (Seaver, 2019, p. 4 29). 
Three examples of persuasive design for attention engineering include infinite scroll, choice architecture, and sentiment 
manipulation. Infinite scroll and autoplay are informed by intermittent conditioning, a technique appropriated from the gambl ing 
industry, to induce a state of immersion, time and space distortion, and self -forgetting in the user, in order to increase their 
engagement and time -on-platform (Montag, Lachmann, Herrlich, & Zweig, 2019; Zuboff, 2019). Infinite scroll and autoplay 
contrib ute to doomscrolling behaviors and result in user exposure to increasingly polarized content (DeLeon, 2019; Watercutter, 
2020). Choice architecture comprises, in part, the arrangement of system features and deployment of push notifications which subtly 
condition (or reward) user activity on the platform (Thaler, Sunstein, & Balz, 2012; Zuboff, 2019). Visible engagement metrics, 
temporal events, algorithmic filter bubbles, and direct sentiment manipulation in users’ platform feeds leverage social press ure, p eer 
comparison, fear of missing out (FOMO), and social contagion in order to influence the user base at scale (Kramer, Guillory, & 
Hancock, 2014). Ultimately, these persuasive design choices construct the user experience to manipulate the user’s attention,  
attitudes, decisions, and behaviors, a process Zuboff describes as actuation (2019).  
By recognizing the role of privacy in personal wellbeing, privacy literacy can provide opportunities for conscious 
consideration of subtle persuasive design choices and their effects on attention. One such example, The Endless Doomscroller  by 
Ben Grosser, offers an interactive, endless scroll of generic misfortune to promote reflection on interface design, rhetoric, 
psychology, and the social architecture of doomscrolling (2021). As users interact with Grosser's digital art installation , they get a 
sense of  the underlying design and intent behind social and digital media platforms' endless newsfeeds. The emotional impact of the 
experience also reveals how these architectures impact individuals' digital wellbeing. Such learning activities contribute to  attent ion 
literacy and attention autonomy ( Odell, 2019; Rheingold, 2010).  
“BE THE FRICTION”: NEW APPROACHES TO PRIVACY LITERACY   
By shifting the focus of privacy literacy away from front -end platform features and recentering it on people, Hartman -
Caverly and Chisholm endeavor to deliver theoretically -grounded, ethics -focused, and person -centered privacy learning experiences. 
Their Six Private I’s privacy conceptual framework facilitates th e identification of multifaceted privacy impacts and analysis of 
otherwise hidden harms (Hartman -Caverly & Chisholm, 2020, p. 307). Highlighting Benjamin’s notion of “informed refusal” (2019, 
p.184), they engage students in active learning, guide students in the application of decision -making frameworks that empower 
students’ self -awareness of their own privacy and disclosure values, and prompt students in informed considerations of privacy 
benefits, harms, and limits - including the impact of one’s own dis closure on others. The authors’ privacy literacy work is also 
informed by attention autonomy ( Odell, 2019; Rheingold, 2010) and conscientious connectivity (James, 2014). Their participatory 
privacy literacy learning experiences enable them to respond to st udents’ expressed needs, interests, and values (Chisholm & 
Hartman -Caverly, 2020).  
The authors’ Digital Shred Privacy Literacy Toolkit provides a curated repository of resources to support other educators 
in developing their own privacy literacy programmin g (Chisholm & Hartman -Caverly, 2021a). Their emphasis on the positive case 
for privacy in the human condition makes the resulting privacy literacy learning experiences extensible, generalizable and 
transferable to a number of curricular and co -curricular c ontexts, and evergreen in light of technology updates and an evolving 
regulatory environment. Education alone cannot solve all of the industrial -scale privacy problems that Hagendorff (2018) describe s 
–but it can inspire participants to “be the friction” ( Zuboff, 2019, p. 520) in the machine.

TRANSITIONARY TEACHING TOOLKIT : BEST PRACTICES FOR 
CREATING AN ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT 
FOR SYNCHRONOUS ONLINE INSTRUCTION  
MARGARET MCLAUGHLIN  AND MEGGAN PRESS  
INTRODUCTION  
 Creating accessible, inclusive teaching spaces has been an ongoing challenge for instructors of all kinds. The sudden 
transition to online teaching caused by the COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated many of these concerns, as, in many ways, synchronous 
online instruction comes with increased barriers; those without essentials such as functioning technology, a strong bandwidth  and 
internet connection, or a home environ ment that allows for stable and undistracted engagement can suffer. However, the affordances 
of Zoom and other software used for online teaching, when used to their full advantage, have the potential to transform teach ing 
spaces to increase accessibility a nd inclusivity for students.  
Our LOEX 2021 conference presentation was divided into two parts. The first part shared a compilation of resources and 
tips geared towards increasing the accessibility, inclusivity, and efficacy of online library instruction se ssions. Covering various 
stages of teaching preparation and execution, these suggestions aim to help instructors incorporate accessibility and inclusi vity 
practices by gaining a stronger background in accessible online teaching, familiarizing themselves wi th open educational materials 
and online teaching repositories, and preparing for and implementing their lessons with accessibility and inclusivity in mind . The 
second part of the presentation consisted of an open -forum discussion and post -session survey. The discussion was a place where 
instructors and librarians could share their own experiences with creating accessible, inclusive online learning spaces; the survey 
created a space for identifying resources and asking follow -up questions. Through our prese ntation and this paper, we hope to provide 
a framework for considering and implementing accessibility practices into online teaching settings.  
OUR RESOURCES  
 During the first part of our presentation, we shared resources that we co -created to help foster accessible and inclusive 
learning spaces. These consisted of a Best Practices for Online Teaching document and a Teaching Librarians Summer School  
Canvas Commons page. Both can be accessed in the appendi ces. 
Best Practices Document  
The initial shift to online teaching was a last -minute emergency caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. As such, many 
educators were unprepared to drastically change their pedagogy to adapt to online methods of instruction. As it became appare nt that 
online inst ruction would continue in the following academic year, we wanted to more intentionally create inclusive teaching practices 
not only for the upcoming year of online instruction but for subsequent semesters, regardless of classroom format. Online tea ching 
has both benefits and drawbacks. We hoped to systematically identify the benefits and reduce the drawbacks of online teaching a nd 
foster teaching practices that were both immediately applicable and adaptable for future use.   
 
154        LOEX -2021   -MCLAUGHLIN AND PRESS - To do this, Margaret and Meggan decided to set up a series of observations to glean common best practices used by a variety 
of teaching librarians and other instructors. Margaret attended several instruction sessions from teaching librarians across a variety 
of disciplines. She took note s, observing what went well and identifying areas for improvement. After the session, Margaret would 
meet with the instructor for a post -session interview and discuss what resources and tools the instructor used to create accessible and 
inclusive teaching spaces. After a semester of observations, combined with Margaret and Meggan’s personal teaching experiences 
as instructors for semester -long class es, Margaret identified common best practices for creating accessible and inclusive online 
learning spaces. Sh e compiled them into a single page Best Practices for Online Teaching document  (Appendix A).   
The document is divided into three parts. The first part consists of background and continuing education resources (such as  
Library Juice Academy  and MERLOT ) that instructors can use to improve their teaching practices. The second part provides tips to 
consider when planning an instruction session, such as checking the a ccessibility of your teaching materials and sharing them with 
the class ahead of time. The third section gives an overview of best practices to use during the actual instruction session, such as 
using inclusive language and testing your camera and micropho ne ahead of time. The Best Practices for Online Teaching document 
is not meant to be a fi xed, exhaustive resource but rather serve as a starting point to help instructors consider their pedagogical 
accessibility and inclusivity.  
Canvas Commons  
The Teachin g Librarians Summer School course was conceived in response to the necessary transition to online learning 
during the pandemic. The intent was to create an open educational resource of adaptable, high -quality materials for engaging teaching 
librarians in c oncepts related to online pedagogy. The list of modules grew out of a May 2020 meeting of the  Indiana University 
Libraries’ Teaching Librarians Community. As librarians expressed their fears and anxieties about teaching online, the Teachi ng and 
Learning De partment recognized an opportunity to involve librarians in sharing their expertise with colleagues in a format that was 
similar to the one that many of our students would be engaging in for the next academic year.   
Using crowd -sourced expertise from acros s the library, these modules were created and released on a rolling basis over the 
course of the summer of 2020. Because of the wide range of needs and experience s present among our librarians, it was important 
that the modules offer something for everyone . As a result, each module has three parts, intended to cover a wide range of interest s 
and previous experience s: quick start, resources, and level up. The seven modules are:  
• Accessibility for Online Learning Objects  
• Inclusive Teaching Pedagogy  
• Video Produ ction  
• Active Learning in Online Spaces  
• Zoom for Teaching  
• Infographic Resources  
• LibGuide Refresher  
The Teaching Librarians Community Summer School course is an open educational resource available for use and 
adaptation via Canvas Commons. As Canvas is itself an open application, the course is available to anyone with a free account  
regardless of an inst itution’s chosen learning management system. Creating this course allowed us to create a stable repository of 
resources for accessible and inclusive teaching practices, bringing these topics into equal visibility with more “immediate” online 
teaching conce rns such as video production and Zoom for teaching. Additionally, it reminds our department to continue to adapt, 
extend, and share our learning and practices with others.  
OUR PRACTICES  
 During the LOEX 2021 conference session, we each shared a handful of  accessible and inclusive practices that have been 
working for us recently. For example, Meggan has been asking people to pronounce their own names in her sessions. This is even 
easier to accomplish in an online environment where names are displayed on scr een. Before asking for participation from students, 
Meggan usually tells students that she’s likely to mispronounce names and that she would like to be corrected in her pronunci ation. 
She makes a good faith effort at pronouncing the student’s name as it ap pears on screen and if corrected, repeats it back to the student 
to confirm. Doing this is important for students to feel seen as a person worthy of naming, and it shows a willingness  to make 
mistakes and be corrected . 
Meggan has run across a few instances  where there has been an American Sign Language interpreter present in her sessions 
unexpectedly. In these instances, she will send the interpreter a private message asking if there is anything she needs to be  aware of 
during the session to create conditio ns for successful interpretation for the student. Meggan has also been using Grackle, which is 
an add -on that will run an accessibility check on materials created with Google Suite products.   
-TRANSITIONARY TEACHING TOOLKIT : BEST PRACTICES FOR CREATING …- LOEX -2021       155 Margaret has been focusing on using inclusive language. She clea rly displays and pronounces her full name and pronouns, 
and she asks students to do the same. She opts for the gender -neutral “they/them” when referring to students whose pronouns have 
not been specified. She tries to avoid using gendered terms such as “gu ys'', opting for a gender -neutral term such as “folks .” Perhaps 
most importantly for Margaret, if she makes a mistake,  she directly acknowledges it and corrects herself. The aim of using inclusive 
language is not to be perfect, but instead to practice usin g language that makes everyone feel welcome until it becomes a natural part 
of your speech.   
In her own pedagogy, Margaret has been structuring her class to include both synchronous and asynchronous options. 
Students can choose to attend the synchronous weekly Zoom class, or asynchronously complete the weekly module and discussion 
post through Can vas, IU Bloomington’s learning management software. When teaching synchronously, she welcomes participation 
through all methods, using both “face -to-face” conversation and the chat function. Providing students with a variety of ways to 
participate and comp lete the course requirements grants students options and agency as learners and helps a wider range of students 
succeed.    
PADLET  
 During the conference session, we used a Padlet to create interactiv e opportunities for conversation and sharing amongst 
the 94 participants. After sharing our experiences with developing materials and incorporating best practices for accessible and 
inclusive online synchronous instruction, we asked the participants to share to the Padlet inclusive and accessible practices  that have 
been working for them or that they have seen work well for others, resources they would recommend, and any questions they are  
wrestling with. Below is a summary of those responses.  
Inclusive practices:  
• Using multiple modes of representation of informa tion where possible.  
o Repeat  instructions for an activity verbally, on a presentation slide, and also within a Google doc or wherever an 
activity may be taking place.  
o Share materials used in class, ideally beforehand. This includes slides, handouts, notes,  and a recording of the 
session if allowed . 
• Be clear in expectations . 
o Ask students to turn off their microphones , particularly in large classes  
o Define  expectations of participation such as:  
▪ Participation options (cameras on/off, etc.)  
▪ What good participati on looks like  
▪ Being gracious with each other  
• Keep it simple . 
o Choose software that does not require students to create their own accounts. This cuts down on class time used to 
support the technology as well as reducing the barrier to entry for the class . 
o Choose one technology (Google  or Padlet) rather than having students jump around to a bunch of different 
applications, some of which may be new to them.  
o Allow  anonymous participation options in any interactive element, such as choosing to allow anon ymous 
responses in Padlet . 
• Consider access from a world -wide perspective , such as  creating options for students to participate if they are in a country 
where they cannot access Google.  
• Depending on the size of the class, consider using two presenters. One can be the main presenter while the other takes care 
of moderating the chat, creating breakout rooms, etc. This is particularly helpful for large class sizes.  
 
Accessible practices : 
• When booking a class, include as a standard question for faculty if there are any students who need accommodation.  
o This question can be phrased to capture accessibility -related considerations and can also help reveal information 
about the class cohort that can be useful such as a high portion of international students or first -generation students . 
• Closed captioning  
o Include closed captioning for all video or other multimedia materials  
o Both PowerPoint and Google Slides offer live closed captioning when you present  
o Whenever possible, edit any auto -generated closed captioning for acc uracy  
• Built -in tools  
o Utilize headings in documents whenever possible rather than bolding or underlining text as a means to set it apart 
from the body text. Headings help screen readers accurately interpret the information . 
o Consider using an accessibility c hecker such as Grackle. If not, make sure to double check headings, alt text, and 
layout for accessibility . 
156        LOEX -2021   -MCLAUGHLIN AND PRESS - o Check how materials are viewed on multiple devices such as computer, phone, tablet, etc.  
 
Resources : 
• Springshare, purveyor of common library software such as LibGuides and LibAnswers, offers great resources on writing 
for the web.  
• Padlet is great for active participation, allows anonymous responses and upvoting, can be downloaded as a pdf and shared 
with class after the fact.  
• PearDeck was mentioned as a useful add -on for Google Slides which provides free templates and access to interactive 
components via a code rather than an account.  
• ProjectENABLE is a resource that provides professional development to li brary professionals from all types of libraries in 
order to build capacity for providing equitable access and services to patrons with disabilities.  
• Google Jamboard is a simple, pared -down space to allow student participation, especially when paired with Z oom breakout 
rooms.  
• Mentimeter and PollEverywhere were the preferred polling options.  
 
Muddy questions : 
• Working with faculty who do not take a trauma -informed approach to their instruction  
• Knowing which of the many options for tools to use to increase enga gement are accessible  
• What are best practices for writing alt text? How descriptive should it be to be most helpful?  
• Resources for blind students  
• How to hold on to participation options such as chat and polling when we return to in -person teaching. One par ticipant 
offered that they are going to try the Q&A feature of Google Slides for this.  
• Wondering if engagement issues are accessibility issues  
• Struggling with synchronous sessions when students are accessing via phones or unstable internet connections.  
 
POST-SESSION SURVEY  
At the end of the  session, we asked participants to complete a reflective survey. We asked the following questions:  
1. Identify one practice you learned about today that you will incorporate into your teaching practice going forward.  
2. What questions are lingering for you surrounding teaching practices to support accessibility and inclusivity?  
 
Responses to the first question could be grouped to replicate the structure of the Best Practices document. Respondents 
identified background resources, tools for preparing for the session, and practices to use during the session. Responses to the question  
are summarized as follows:  
• Background and continuing education resources  
o Using open repositories (like Canvas Commons ) 
o Familiarizing themselves with various learning tools, such as Peardeck  and Padlet  
• Preparation  
o Sharing resources and learning materials with the class ahead of time (e.g., through Google docs)  
o Checking the accessibility of documen ts and teaching materials (e.g., using Grackle for Google slides , properly 
structuring their document for screen readers, etc.)  
• During Session  
o Using closed captioning  
o Clearly identif ying personal pronouns and asking students to display their pronouns   
o Using non -gendered, inclusive, and accessible language  
 
Responses to the second question did not fall as clearly into groups, but fell under the following general categories:  
• How to advo cate for accessibility/effectively share tips with colleagues   
• How to combine good things about online and moving them into physical classroom   
• Questions regarding time management, mostly in background preparation and lesson planning  
• Tips for replacing non -accessible documents and tools  
• How one -shot sessions differ from semester -long courses  
  
-TRANSITIONARY TEACHING TOOLKIT : BEST PRACTICES FOR CREATING …- LOEX -2021       157 CONCLUSION  
Through our session, we aimed to identify resources and tools for instructors that fostered inclusive and accessible pedagogy  
as well as share best practices for creating accessible and inclusive teaching environments. We reviewed the resources we cre ated 
(including the Best Practices Document and the Teaching Librarians Summer School course) and shared what changes we had made 
to our pedagogy. Our workshop co -created a more thorough list and identified further questions to consider moving forward.

BEST PRACTICES FOR ONLINE TEACHING  
Background and Resources  
If you know you will be teaching an online instruction session, consider your experience with online pedagogy 
and your knowledge of available resources. Review the following resources and suggestions to help you 
prepare for online teaching and create more accessible, engaging sessions:  
• Consider taking an online course for accessibility  
o Library Juice Academy  provides a variety of courses  
• Familiarize  yourself with open repositories to inform your pedagogy and provide teaching materials  
o MERLOT  is a repository that provides collections of teaching materials covering a wide range 
of disciplines. For example, their Library Instruction Collection  provides materials for teaching 
students about using library resources.  
o With the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy Sandbox , instructors can explore various 
ways to integrate the Framewo rk for Information Literacy for Higher Education into their 
instruction sessions.  
• Check if your institution has an OER or teaching materials repository   
o For example, IU’s Canvas Commons  is an institution -specific le arning object repository for 
storing, finding, importing, and sharing course materials.   
Lesson Planning and Preparation  
While preparing for your instruction session, consider how the size and scope of your class will affect your 
teaching. Consider the fol lowing suggestions while planning for your lesson:  
• When confirming your instruction session, ask the course’s instructor if anybody needs 
accommodations, such as closed captioning or an ASL signer  
• Consider sharing finalized versions of any activities or materials with the class through a cloud -
sharing system, such as Google Drive, prior to the actual session. This lets students and instructors 
familiarize themselves with materials and saves time during the actual teaching session  
• If you will  have slides, use a platform compatible with closed captioning and include them in your 
presentation  
o For example, Google Slides provides automatic closed captioning. When presenting, press 
“control shift c” on a PC or “command shift c” on a mac to initiati ve closed captioning  
During Session  
There are several ways to increase the accessibility and efficacy of your instruction during the actual session. 
Please consider the following tips:  
• Test your video and audio before the session. If you are in a setting w ith a lot of background noise, 
use headphones with a working microphone  
• Pull up any external links, slides, or other resources ahead of time so you are prepared to share 
them with the course  
• Include your full and name pronouns in your display name during t he session  
• If session -size allows, ask all students to pronounce their names and provide their pronouns. If the 
class size is too large, ask students to include their preferred name and pronouns in their display 
names   
• Onlines teaching lets students and in structors engage with each other in multiple ways. Be sure to 
check the chat and encourage all sorts of participation. Some students may not feel comfortable 
speaking and would prefer to chat, and vice versa
